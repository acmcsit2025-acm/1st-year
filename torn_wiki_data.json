Torn is a long-term endeavour and gets more exciting the longer you're here.\nIf you overdo it, you'll need to wait for your energy to regenerate naturally. To speed this up you could buy a donator pack for increased energy levels and quicker recovery time.\nGood Luck my friend. And if you ever see someone who looks like your pal George lying in the gutter, do me a favour and whizz in the other direction. See ya around new player."

        "title": "API",
        "url": "https://wiki.torn.com/wiki/API",
        "content": "Contents\n1 Details\n2 Introduction\n3 Potential\n4 Acceptable usage\n5 Unfair advantage\n6 Logging\n7 Automatic limits & blocks\n8 Access Levels\n9 Error codes\n10 Examples\n11 Safe to use applications\n12 Patch History\n13 References\nDetails\nThe 'API' is a new tool made by Torn you can use to build your own applications / extensions for Torn. The info on this page is copied directly from the API's site (with info added from several people spread out over Torn ), so make sure to read it carefully before using the API.\nTo start using the API go here and then click on the 'try it' button. Then you can fill in your API key at the top, this can be found under the 'API key' section on this page. Then select for example the user section, fill in your id and a selection of your choice.\nIf you do not know the selections and they are not displayed on the 'try it' section, you can always go to http://api.torn.com/user/?selections=lookup&key=apikeyhere to see what the possible selections are.\nIntroduction\nFirstly what does API stand for? It stands for Application Programming Interface. A full definition can be found here, but what's more important is what it can do, and you can find in the details section of this page.\nThe goal of the Torn API is to provide a fully supported and read-only method for players to pull useful information from Torn about their player, faction, or company. This can be used individually to retrieve information about your account, or you can build a website that the entire community can use to do interesting things with the data exposed via the API.\nPotential\nWhether you're making a browser extension to aid factions during wartime, a mobile application to offer instant notifications, or a website to track data for graphing - the possibilities are endless - simply using the 16 character API keys. We encourage you to be creative, building features and tools that expand Torn's gameplay and enjoyment.\nAcceptable usage\nThis system has been developed so that you only ever need to request an API key from the user. All of the user's information can be obtained with just their key, there shouldn't be any requirement to ask for a name or user ID. Torn passwords should never be requested from any users, ever.\nYou must keep keys, and the data obtained from them, securely protected and confidential unless permitted by the key owner. By accepting other user's keys, they are placing their trust in you - do not exploit this. We will permanently ban offending applications from accessing the API at a moment's notice.\nWe respectfully request that you follow Torn's no-advertising policy when building websites or applications that use our API system to ensure optimal user experience, however, exceptions can be made. Please contact us if you would like to advertise, accept voluntary real-money donations or charge users for usage.\nPlease make sure your scripts are optimised to retrieve only the information required for the specific request they're making. They should be retrieving as little information as possible; this will improve loading time and reduce stress on Torn's servers.\nUnfair advantage\nWe understand that crafting an API system for Torn could give some users an unfair advantage. We want the system to expand & enhance gameplay rather than giving users an advantage which makes it easier to compete against others. We have taken this into account during development, but we will be listening to feedback and making any appropriate changes that are required.\nLogging\nPlease be aware, we log all details and inputs of requests and make routine checks. If misuse occurs, we will permanently ban IP addresses, keys, and users from accessing the system without notice.\nAutomatic limits & blocks\nEach user key can make up to 100 individual requests per minute, this should be more than enough for almost anything to be achievable. Multiple requests using invalid keys may result in a temporary IP ban - you must account for this by removing disabled or invalid keys upon error.\nThese limits may change without notice to ensure the Torn servers remain stable.\nAccess Levels\nUsers can create different keys for use in different scripts or tools. Users can hold 10 keys with different levels of access to their player data and each key can be separately deleted whenever the user wants it. Each access level has restrictions on data that can be fetched by the script using the key.\nThere are 4 access levels for each key, namely \"Public Only\", \"Minimal Access\", \"Limited Access\", \"Full Access\" and the information which can be accessed by the key can be found in the API Documentation.\nError codes\n0 => Unknown error : Unhandled error, should not occur.\n1 => Key is empty : Private key is empty in current request.\n2 => Incorrect Key : Private key is wrong/incorrect format.\n3 => Wrong type : Requesting an incorrect basic type.\n4 => Wrong fields : Requesting incorrect selection fields.\n5 => Too many requests : Current private key is banned for a small period of time because of too many requests (max 100 per minute).\n6 => Incorrect ID : Wrong ID value.\n7 => Incorrect ID-entity relation : A requested selection is private (For example, personal data of another user / faction).\n8 => IP block : Current IP is banned for a small period of time because of abuse.\n9 => API disabled : API system is currently disabled.\n10 => Key owner is in federal jail : Current key can't be used because owner is in federal jail.\n11 => Key change error : You can only change your API key once every 60 seconds.\n12 => Key read error : Error reading key from Database.\n13 => The key is temporarily disabled due to owner inactivity : An inactive player's key may not make API calls after 7 days.\n14 => Daily read limit reached : Too many records have been pulled today by this user from our cloud services.\n15 => Temporary error : An error code specifically for testing purposes that has no dedicated meaning.\n16 => Access level of this key is not high enough : A selection is being called of which this key does not have permission to access.\n17 => Backend error occurred, please try again\n18 => API key has been paused by the owner\nExamples\nHere there'll be short examples of code in several languages to see how you can use it.\nJavascript\nfetch(\"https://api.torn.com/user/?selections=skills&key=APIKEY\") // Fetches data from API\n.then((response) => response.json()) // Converts the fetched data into JSON\n.then((jsonResponse) => console.log(jsonResponse)); // Prints the JSON\n\nPython\nimport requests\n\nr = requests.get(\"apiurl\") # queries \"apiurl\" and returns response from Torn\n\ndata = r.json()            # translates that response into a dict variable\n\nprint(data)                # prints that variable\n\nPHP\n    $jsonurl = \"http://api.torn.com/user/[MyID]?selections=networth&key=[MyKey]\";\n    $json = file_get_contents($jsonurl); //gets output of API\n        \n    $decodedString = json_decode($json, true); //parses API JSON output\n    $nwtotal = $decodedString[\"networth\"]; //Pulls networth out of JSON array\n    echo \"Stock Market: \".$nwtotal[\"stockmarket\"].\"</br>\"; // Spits out networth from stocks\n    echo \"Networth Total: \".$nwtotal[\"total\"].\"</br>\"; // Spits out total networth\n\nSafe to use applications\nHere there'll be a list of well known safe to use applications that require your API:\nTorn Stats, made by IceBlueFire\nDoctorN, made by Mauk\nTornTools, made by Mephiles\nYATA, made by Kivou\nTorn PDA, made by Manuito\nPatch History\nReleased in Patch list #294\nReferences"

        "title": "Attack",
        "url": "https://wiki.torn.com/wiki/Attack",
        "content": "An Attack is a method of using Energy to target another player, in order to put them in Hospital, gain respect or even Mug cash from them.\nContents\n1 Basics\n2 The Player Model\n3 Possible Outcomes\n3.1 Winning\n3.2 Not winning\n3.3 Interruptions\n4 Equipment\n4.1 Weapons\n4.2 Armor\n5 Group Attacks\n5.1 Aggression\n5.2 Suppression\n6 Attack Settings\n7 Related Awards\n8 Historical Notes\n9 Patch History\n10 References\nBasics\nTo attack another player it costs 25 energy, with the exception of attacks under the effect of Love Juice during the Valentines Event when it costs 15.\nOnce an attack has been initiated you will have 25 \"turns\" or five minutes to defeat your opponent. A turn can include using a Weapon or Temporary item, reloading, or attempting to escape.\nBetween each attacking turn during a fight, there is a one second cooldown.\nAfter 25 turns, if neither player has won, the fight results in a Stalemate. After five minutes, if 25 turns have not been used the fight results in a \"timeout\" - equivalent to a loss for the attacker.\nWhile a player is actively traveling (with the profile status of 'Traveling to/Returning from'), they cannot be attacked. Players in the same country can attack each other, unless the intended target's last action is greater than 168 hours, in which case they are \"Hiding out\" and do not appear on the 'People' list of that country. However, players who are \"Hiding out\" can be attacked if they are the intended target of a mission, in which case they will appear at the top of the 'People\" list and highlighted in pink.\nThe Player Model\nWhen attacking a player there are 14 body parts you can hit. Three of these are critical hits, dealing the most damage to an opponent.\n\nNote: The values presented below were determined through large attack data-sets - there has been as of yet no official confirmation from developers.\nBody Part Damage\nBody Part Damage Multiplier\nHead (critical) 3.5\nThroat (critical) 3.5\nHeart (critical) 3.5\nChest 2\nStomach 2\nGroin 2\nArm (left/right) 1\nHand (left/right) 0.7\nLeg (left/right) 1\nFoot (left/right) 0.7\nThe chance to land a critical hit begins at 12% and can be increased by +3% with the Education BIO2410: Anatomy, by +0.5% for each Merit upgrade into Critical Hit Rate (for a total of +5%), and by +2-5% with the Laser Weapon Mods.\n\nThroat damage can be increased by 10% with the Education BIO2380: Fundamentals of Neurobiology.\nPossible Outcomes\nWinning\nThere are numerous possible results from an attack, whether you manage to defeat an opponent or not:\nLeaving\nLeaving an opponent provides the attacker with the most level experience of any option, and gives the defender the least amount of hospital time (15 - 30 minutes).\nMain article: Leave\nMugging\nMugging an opponent allows the attacker to steal a percentage of the defenders cash-on-hand (between 5 and 15%). A mug provides the attacker with reduced respect and level experience compared with leaving an opponent, and gives the defender approximately a base hospital time of 30 - 45 minutes.\nMain article: Mug\nHospitalizing\nHospitalizing an opponent puts the defender into hospital for the most amount of time possible (base: 3 - 3.5 hours). Hospitalizing provides the least amount of level experience of any outcome; it may be done in order to retaliate against an enemy faction member, to collect bounties, or for a mission requirement.\nMain article: Hospitalize\nArresting\nIt is also possible to arrest a player, sending them to jail for a cash reward, if you're a part of a Detective Agency of at least 3 stars.\nMain article: Arrest\nLooting\nSeveral NPC accounts are available for Looting. Looting provides a number of attackers (based on the Loot Level of the NPC at the time of defeat) with special NPC items, using a lottery system.\nMain article: Loot\nMission Outcomes\nSome missions require the use of unusual options after defeating a target, such as \"Kiss\", \"Interrogate\", and \"Secrete <object>\".\nMain article: Mission\nNot winning\nEscaping\nAn attacker can attempt to escape from an opponent on the turn after a turn where the defender misses. The escape is successful if the defender misses again, which means your escape chance is based on the attacker's dexterity compared with the defender's speed. Note: hitting for zero damage or using a non-damaging temporary item is the equivalent of missing, and thus if the defender does either of those the attacker may escape.[1]\nStalemating\nAfter 25 turns, if neither player has defeated the other, the fight will end in a stalemate. Stalemates do not provide respect for the attacker.\nLosing\nIf an attacker loses their fight, they will be sent to the hospital for 15 - 30 minutes. Any current kill-streak will be broken.\nTiming out\nA fight will end automatically after five minutes, even if neither attacker nor defender has actually lost all of their life. This will send the attacker to the hospital and break their kill-streak; it is equivalent to losing the fight. This will be considered a defend won for the defender.\nInterruptions\nA fight may become \"interrupted\" for a number of reasons. Any of these results will not count as successful nor unsuccessful attacks, stalemates or defends for either player.\n<Player> took down your opponent\nIf the defender is attacking another <Player>, they may lose their fight before the attacker is able to win themselves. In this event the fight result will display <Player took down your opponent>.\n<Defender> was defeated by <Player>\nIf multiple attackers are fighting a defender, only one of them can actually win. In the event they defeat the defender, for every attacker that did not land the finishing blow, the fight result will read \"<Player> defeated <Defender>\" and this will count as an assist in personal stats.\n<Defender was sent to hospital>\nThere are many ways in which a player can be sent to hospital while being attacked, before they are defeated by the attacker. These may include opening a parcel with a Small Explosive Device inside, being hurt by Leslie from Spin the Wheel, or an Organized Crime result.\n<Defender was surrounded by police>\nAs of 21/09/21, only organised crimes can cause this result.\nEquipment\nIn preparation for an attack you may equip three weapons (primary, secondary and melee), a temporary item (a variety of grenades and temporary stat boosters), as well as five pieces of Armor.\nWeapons\nAll primary and secondary weapons are guns that require Ammo to be used in a fight. This means that not only is reloading (using up a turn) necessary, but it is possible to completely run out of ammo during a fight, based on clip size and rate of fire.\nMelee weapons do not require ammo, however unlike primary and secondary weapons they cannot attach Weapon Mods in order to improve the weapon.\nMain article: Weapon\nArmor\nWearing armor reduces the damage received from an opponent; the armor rating represents the percentage of the damage reduction. For example, a 40.00 rated piece of armor reduces damage taken by 40%, so a 1000 damage hit actually only deals 600 damage.\nThe following equation can be used to determine the damage received while wearing armor:\nD(A) = D(I) * (1-A/100)\nwhere D(I) is the Initial damage dealt by an opponent, A is the armor rating of the piece being worn, and D(A) is the resultant damage received with this armor equipped.\nMain article: Armor\nGroup Attacks\nWhen multiple players attack an opponent, that defender's stats can be effectively reduced. For every additional player (beyond the first) that makes an action against a defender within the last 30 seconds, a level of distraction is added. However, this effect is capped at 25 levels, limiting how much a defender’s stats can be reduced.\nRead the main article for a full understanding of how distraction is personalized to each attacker.\nMain article: Distraction\nAggression\nAggression relates to a player's Strength and Speed.\nDistraction affects a defenders ability to make a turn against an attacker; a defender will have a \"one in number-of-attackers\" chance to make a turn, every time an attacker makes a turn against them. For example, if two players attack a defender, each time they make a turn the defender will have a 50% chance to make a turn back against them.\nSuppression\nSuppression relates to a player's Defense and Dexterity.\nDistraction affects a defenders Defense and Dexterity stats directly; a defender will have their effective Defense and Dexterity halved for every level of distraction that is active. For example, if two players attack a defender with 10,000,000 defense and 5,000,000 dexterity, each time they make a turn the defender will appear to have 5,000,000 defense and 2,500,000 dexterity.\nAttack Settings\nAttack settings can be adjusted in your Preferences (or via direct link here).\nThe attacking settings include an option regarding your stealth preference. You can select between \"Whenever possible\" and \"Off\". Additionally you can select whether to re-equip temporary items from your inventory after one is used in a fight, provided you own multiple. (Note: Faction loaned Temps will be re-equipped first) Although specifically under the \"attacking\" subheading, temporary items will also re-equip after a defense if used.\nThe defending settings effectively allow a player to decide which weapons get used and how often, when they are defending an attack from another player. There are four sliding bars (for primary, secondary, melee and temporary) that can be adjusted between 0 and 100. These numbers work as ratios for how often each will be used in a defense - better explained through an example. With:\nPrimary set to 100,\nSecondary set to 75,\nMelee is set to 50 and\nTemporary is set to 25\nthe total of these numbers equals 250 - so for each turn the defender has, they will have a 100/250 chance of using primary, a 75/250 chance of using secondary, a 50/250 chance of using melee and a 25/250 chance of using a temporary item.\nIf one of these slots is left empty (for example, if you unequip your primary weapon), during a fight you can consider this bar to be set at 0 in order to recalculate the odds for each weapon to be used. When the temporary item is used up, there is no longer a temporary item equipped and thus the setting here is also effectively set at 0.\nPrimary and secondary weapons come with an option to reload (\"on\" or \"off\"). If either of these weapons has reloads \"off\", when they run out of ammo their respective bar will effectively be set at 0, as above.\nFinally, if you have it unlocked you can select between \"Fists\" and \"Kick\" when fighting unarmed.

The attacker can then attempt to escape again later, or keep fighting.\nThe 'Escape' button is disabled if the defender causes damage on the turn.

Higher stage mods only become available once all prior stages are owned.\nTemporary booster: Tyrosine : 09/08/16\nA new booster focusing on Dexterity has been added called 'Tyrosine'. It is now available in the pharmacy for those who have completed the Biology bachelor.\nAttacking stealth changes : 23/06/16\nStealth no longer dependent entirely on how much more dexterity you have over your opponent.\n8 factors: Weapon stealth level, Dexterity difference, Face masks, Stealth merits, Amount of turns, Temporary weapons, Company bonus, Education bonus.\nUnique weapons and armor : 08/12/15\nAll weapons and armor have actual accuracy, damage and defensive values as well as empty slots for attachments and bonuses.\nEvery individual weapon and armor has slightly different statistics.\nAddiction, Plushies and Attacking : 02/12/14\nChanges made to Attacking formulas (Strength vs. Defense, Speed vs. Dexterity).\nDefending Preferences : 25/11/14\nOption to use temporary weapons / items while defending.\nSet the usage rate of each weapon you have while defending.\nChoose to turn on or off Primary and Secondary weapon reloads while defending.\nOption to automatically re-equip temporary items after attacks.\nAttacking 2.0 : 28/10/14\nAttacking 2.0 engine released.\nDamage is now logarithmic.\nLife is now set to a range of 100 - 5,000 based on level. 7,500 is possible at level 100 with merits. Overdosing on Xanax now does not decrease maximum life.\nDefence will reduce damage by 50% if it matches your opponents strength. It will reduce damage by further 10% increments for every doubling of the other users strength.\nArmour now gives a static percent reduction of enemy damage.\nWeapons now act as a simple multiplier on damage. For example, Fists are 1 and ArmaLite Rifle is 6.6.\nAttacking now costs 25 energy even without Vicodin. Vicodin now boosts all stats passively by 25% during attacking and defending.\nAmmo is now purchased per round instead of per clip. Clips are automatically created at the beginning of a fight depending on the rounds available, you will never need to load them manually - just ensure you have enough rounds purchased\nGroup attacking is now a viable tactic. All attackers can make use of a temporary debuff weapon used by just one of them, debuffs will also stack. On top of this, if multiple users are attacking one target, the targets stats will receive a passive reduction and they will sometimes miss turns due to being busy with other attackers.\nWe now have a far more advanced recap log with filter settings and colour coding for each user involved in the attack.\nThe log shown below the fight while attacking someone is now live, so youre able to watch actions happening which involve this user.\nLife now goes up by 5% every 5 minutes at base (100 mins). Medical facilities with doctors will increase this to 6% every 5 minutes (85 mins).\nMugging has also received some big changes. Mugging the same person over and over again is no longer worthwhile, however initial successful mugs will yield more money. It is now unnecessary to have revives turned off in order to avoid repeat mug attempts. Mugging will also place the user in hospital for slightly longer, to differentiate it from the leave on street option.\n\nReferences\n↑ Chedburn, Run away / Escape changes (11/07/17).\n↑ Chedburn, Mugging changes 2019 (22/09/19).\n↑ Chedburn, Mugging rates 2019 - Poll #2 (24/09/19).\n↑ Chedburn, Mugging rates 2019 - Poll #3 (29/09/19).\n↑ Chedburn, Mugging rates 2019 - Poll #4 (16/10/19).\n↑ Chedburn, Mugging changes live (29/10/19).\n\nAttacking\nThe Engine The Basics · Battle Stats · Distraction · Weapon Stats · Weapon Bonus · Elo\nEquipment Weapon · Armor · Loadout\nResults Leave · Mug · Hospitalize · Arrest"

made available to be bought with tokens, here is the list of the previous way of obtaining them:\nThe socialist: Reach level 5 in Torn Lite\nJack of all trades: Complete first 4 levels of Endurance Challenge\nProven capacity: Complete 5th level of Endurance Challenge\nMaster of one: Complete bonus task of Endurance Challenge\nGlobally effective: Complete 6th level of Endurance Challenge\nResistance: Kill 50 zombies as a civilian in the \"Torn of the Dead\" event\nBrainz: Infect 50 civilians as a zombie in the \"Torn of the Dead\" event\nSurvivor: Survive the entire month of \"Torn of the Dead\" as a civilian\nAs of 23/06/2016 Faction Commitment days no longer have to be consecutive, the system will remember how long you have been in a faction even if you take a leave from it and then come back.\nThe Socialist honor used to award a Goodie Bag and the Book temporary weapon, however this was removed on 10/08/2017.\nThe medals for Donator Days previously were awarded for Voting for Torn on various gaming sites. However, the voting process was suspended for a time, and the medals frozen. Ultimately they were replaced with the Donator Days with the update of Nov. 10, 2011 [1]. Those who had Voting Medals retained them, and their Donator Days are added on top of their prior voting total.\nThe Luxury Real Estate honor originally was given for ownership of a Private Island. As of the Patch: Fixes and Updates 19/02/12, it is now given for customizing a Private Island with an Airstrip.\nThe Attention Seeker medal originally was for using 50,000 medical items. When [2] was added on 03/09/2012 the requirement for this award was reduced to using 25,000 medical items.\nSome ranks names had been changed on 15/02/13: Idol to Idolised, Hero to Heroic and Legend to Legendary.\nWith the change to the newspaper with the RESPO update players can no longer submit articles to be accepted to be awarded the Journalist honor. This is now restricted only to assigned reporters. Note: recently this change has been reverted, and all players can submit to the newspaper once again.\nThe lottery honor has been changed with the RESPO update, previously called 'Instant Billionaire' is now called 'Lucky Break' due to the addition of a new daily (as well as monthly) lottery draw, the much lower payout on the daily draw meant the previous name no longer made a lot of sense.\nPatch History\nReleased prior to Patch list #1\nPatch List #321 : 09/01/24\nChanged Character Assassination honor bar to be given immediately upon successful guess rather than crack\nPatch list #285 : 18/04/23\nChanged Devastation, Obliteration and Annihilation honors to not be triggered by additional DOT effect damage\nPatch list #257 : 20/09/22\nChanged some honor bars to show different achievement descriptions depending on when they were rewarded\nPatch list #256 : 13/09/22\nAdded 8 previously unavailable legacy honor bars to the Token Shop\nPatch list #170 : 01/12/20\nAdded Wham!

        "content": "For city owned jobs, see Job\nTorn Companies are player owned entities that are made up of cooperative players, and were released on 18 April 2007. [1] The owner of a company also serves as the director and is in charge of managing it.\nFor a list of every company, please visit the Companies List page.\nFor a list of every company special, please visit the Specials List page.\n\nContents\n1 Acquisition\n2 Operation\n2.1 Popularity\n2.2 Efficiency\n2.3 Employee Effectiveness\n2.4 Environment\n2.5 Advertising\n2.6 Application Process\n3 Special Positions\n4 Company Ranking\n5 Employees\n6 Job Specials\n7 Job Points\n8 Closing Hour\n9 Stocks & Education Affecting Companies\n9.1 Director\n9.2 Employee\n10 Upgrades\n10.1 Company Size\n10.2 Staff Room\n10.3 Warehouse\n11 Company Sell Back\n12 Companies\n13 Historical Notes\n14 Miscellaneous Notes\n15 Patch History\n16 References\nAcquisition\nThere are two ways to acquire a company. You can startup a new company: by going to the job listing page in the newspaper, clicking on the company you'd like to start up and then paying the flat cost for just the bare bones with Default Settings.\nOr you can obtain an established company from another player (either via direct transfer, or trade), where the established company can potentially come with employees, inventory (stock items and company vault), and/or upgrades.\nDirect transfer - Gift the company to another employee (nuances unconfirmed)\nTrade - Initiate a trade with an employee that has an Unassigned position, and zero pay.\nOperation\nYou must be at least level 3 to work in a company and at least level 10 to own one.\nTo run a company, a director micromanages every aspect of the company. They must:\nhire player employees\nassign employees to a position that's beneficial to the company\nbudget employee pay\ntrain employees to increase their potential (+50 primary, +25 secondary)\nmanage goods\nadjust the price of goods to maximize profit\norder stock to replenish goods\nbudget advertising to attract more customers\nkeep enough funds in the company vault to be able to pay its employees and advertising budget for an entire week\nAll these aspects boil down to 3 types of measurements to check to see how well your company is doing: Popularity, Efficiency, and Environment\n\nPopularity\nPopularity is the percent of your weekly income compared to the highest weekly income of your company type, regardless of ratings.\nI.E. If you make $5,000,000 compared to the best company which made $10,000,000, your popularity would be 50%. It's just a quick tool to see how you compare to other companies of that type, which useful for understanding how close you are to gaining a rank in the 10 star ranking system.\nEfficiency\nEfficiency is probably the most important bar to keep an eye on. This displays how efficient your employees are on average. Ideally, you would want to keep this at 100% as much as possible. The efficiency itself is capped at 100%. However, the true value may be above this if you have over-performing employees: potentially hiding the ineffectiveness of other employees.\nEmployee Effectiveness\nThere are several factors that impact an employee’s effectiveness. These can be found on the company page under the Employee section with a tooltip shown for each employee.\nThese Factors are:\nWorking Stats - This will increase the higher work stats an employee has. This is displayed as 90 if an employee has the exact stat requirement for the job they are assigned to.[2]\nThe full formula for work stat efficiency is: $efficiency = FLOOR(MIN(45, (45 / $required) * $stat) + MAX(0, (5 * LOG($stat / $required, 2)))) [3]\nSettled In - This will increase by +1 for each consecutive 24 hours an employee has been in the company up to a maximum of +10 (requires 10 days)\nDirector Education - This bonus comes from education courses listed in the next section\nMerits - Employee Effectiveness merits will increase Effectiveness by +1 for each point in this merit branch. This has allowed players with lower stats to compete against better players unwilling to spend the merits, with early numbers suggesting stats can be increased by up to 4 times their base level when fully upgraded.\nAddiction - This negatively impacts effectiveness based on the number of addiction points an employee has accumulated - See Drugs\nInactivity - This negatively impacts effectiveness based on how long an employee goes without being active in Torn. Note: Being active means actually making actions within the game and not simply logging in as per this patch\nEnvironment\nEnvironment is based on the size of the staff room and the number of employees. Drug users and inactive employees will lower your environment score. To compensate, buy bigger staff rooms or hire cleaners and managers, since a low environment score can lower income by up to a third.\nCleaners will boost environment more. Depending on how critical they are to the success of the company, they also might generate profit. The amount of environment that is boosted depends on the Cleaner's / Manager's effectiveness.\nHaving less employees than the staff room's capacity will increase your environment very slightly as they will have more space to work. Larger companies will struggle more to keep their environment score high, but it's not the end of the world if it drops slightly. You may find it's better to keep an employee in a vital job position rather than making up a few environment points by setting them to a cleaner or manager.\nAdvertising\nTo help attract customers, directors are able to set a daily advertising budget. The effects of advertising can be increased by having an employee that is considered a \"Marketer\", completing the BUS2400 and LAW2100 education courses, and by having the benefit block for TGP.\nAdvertising has a maximum base effect of 40% on a company, and will be reduced based on the number of competing companies, and their advertising budgets. If there are 80 companies of the same type with an advertising budget, the company with the highest budget will receive the 40% bonus, with the second highest receiving a 39.5% bonus, the third highest receiving a 39% bonus, etc.[4]\nApplication Process\nPlayers can now have up to 10 pending Applications to companies at the same time. This means they're free to apply to several companies at the same time, greatly increasing the chances they'll get into one quickly. This solves the laborious process of applying to one, waiting for a response, and then applying to another.\nPlayers can edit their applications at any point after they have been sent out, or withdraw them, via the relevant Company profile.\nOnce an application is accepted, all other related applications will be removed. So as a Company director, all of the applications you see will be from players who are available to join now.\nIf an application is declined, the player will not be able to reapply again for 72 hrs. This reapply restriction can be overridden by the Company by toggling \"Allow applications\" off and on again.\nApplications expire after 72 hours if they have not been accepted or declined.\nSpecial Positions\nSpecial Positions are roles that are available to every single company that help boost an aspect of a company. They are positions to give the company a boost in areas that many not directly be related to the product the company is selling, but affect the employee, environment, or advertising instead. An employees effectiveness will determine how strong these effects are.\nThese roles may also generate profit depending on the company.\nSpecial Positions\nPosition Effect\nCleaner Helps keep your environment up\nManager Increases your employee effectiveness\nMarketer Increases the effectiveness of your advertising budget\nSecretary Shows you how much your employees are earning you in detail\nTrainer Gives you extra trains (Maximum of 3)\nCompany Ranking\nThe Company Ranking is a 10 star ranking system based on how well your company has been doing quantified by gross profits. In order to improve a company, you should strive for the best profits because profits only come by running a company efficiently. The company can only rank up to a certain cap - widely believed to be based on gross revenue: if the company has generated more revenue over the course of its lifetime, it has the ability to gain a higher rank.\nCompany Ranking can effect how many job points are granted (1 job point per 1 star), and how many stats a company director gains. Company directors gain working stats based on how high the company has ranked:\n1 star - 5 units of every working stat daily\n2 stars - 10 units\n3 stars - 20 units\n4 stars - 35 units\n5+ stars - 50 units\nYour employee pay does NOT affect your company's ability to star up (a common misconception).\nCompanies have the ability to rank up or down automatically every Sunday.\nEmployees\nWhen applying for a company, your Working Stats will help the director determine your position. The director of the company decides the amount of pay for each employee (up to a cap of $25,000,000.) All positions have different working stat requirements (primary and secondary) and will aid the company in different ways. The primary and secondary work stats are the stats which will help the company you join: the higher they are, the more effective you will be at that role i.e getting more customers, keeping the workplace clean, building hardware faster, etc. The secondary stat is half as influential as your primary stat at the rank.\nEmployee participation is automatically determined by several factors (work stats, drug addiction, and minimum daily activity.) Most of the work is done on the director's side (see above.)\nDirectors can train you to increase your work stats by 50 and 25 for your primary and secondary stat respectively. Job Specials and Director Trains will be locked for a newly hired employee for 72 hours.\nDirector's typically want employee's to have at least twice the stats of the position, particularly companies where lower stats are needed. Director's also like to see employee's keep drug addiction down, but it depends on the job type as to how competitive it needs to be. Employee Effectiveness merits are always useful.\nJob Specials\nJob Specials are special abilities that can either be actively obtained (by spending Job Points obtained at Closing Hour), or passively used (no cost). To unlock the use of Job Specials, the company must reach the required level of stars in its Company Ranking.\nNew employees will have a temporary 'Recruit' restriction which is symbolized by a green company icon. During this period they will not be able to use specials or receive training. After 72 hours, this restriction will be lifted and they will receive the standard grey icon.\nFor job specials that give energy, only 100 job points can be used per day.\nJob Points\nCompany directors and employees get job points daily at 18:00 TCT according to the company's ranking. i.e. If your company is a 2-star you will get 2 job points per day starting from the same day the company gets the stars. These job points can be used for exchanging Job Specials, which are not passive.\nJob points are transferable between companies of the same type, that is, job points accumulated while in a Candle Shop will remain available for use if the player moves to another Candle Shop. Job points are stored for each individual company type and aren't lost until they're spent.\nClosing Hour\nAt the end of the Company day (at approximately 6:00 PM TCT), the company's performance is calculated. This can be seen in the amount of customers that day and the amount of gross income made. At the same time, working stats gains are automatically applied, job points are granted (one point for every one star in Company Ranking), employee pay is automatically divvied out, and employee trains are generated to be used by the director. This operation can take up to 15 minutes before the results are reflected.\nWhile an inactive employee is a big detriment to the company, the company can float by itself without an active director; the employee trains will just stack up to the cap, and not be distributed, and stocks can eventually run out.\n\nStocks & Education Affecting Companies\nDirector\nThe Stock Market has various stocks that can help a company director if a benefit block is held. The stocks that directly benefit companies are:\nTell Group Plc. (TGP) - gives you a significant boost in company advertising effectiveness.\nTC Media Productions (TCP) - gives your company a sales boost.\nSyscore MFG (SYS) - protects your company from being hacked by players with the Intricate Hack company benefit (good for companies that store a lot of money).\nBelow are stocks that can indirectly help a Director:\nMessaging Inc. (MSG) - allows free advertisements in the newspaper which can help recruit employees.\nYazoo (YAZ) - gives free advertisement banners in the newspaper which can help recruit employees.\nEducation courses studied, besides the passive working stat gains from each course, also can have an effect on companies that you own (as a director). These include:\nAll Business Management courses in various ways.\nBUS2200\n, BUS2500\n, BUS2800\n, BUS2100\n, BUS2120\n- Gain 2% productivity for your company\nBUS2300\n- Gain 5% employee effectiveness for your company\nBUS2400\n- Gain an increase in advertising effectiveness for your company\nBUS2600\n- Gain 7% employee effectiveness for your company\nBUS2700\n- Gain the ability to increase product prices by 10% without losing customers\nBUS2900\n- Gain the ability to increase product prices by 5% without losing customers\nBUS2110\n- Gain a passive bonus to employee working stats in your company\nBUS3130\n- Unlock new size, storage size & staff room upgrades for purchase\nThe course MTH2280\nhelps increase company productivity by 1%.\nThe course LAW2100\ngain an increase in advertising effectiveness for your company\nEmployee\nAs an employee, completing Education courses can grant you various amounts of Work Stats. You can increase how quickly you complete Education courses via:\n1 star Fitness Center special \"Healthy Mind\"\n7 star Hair Salon special \"Cutting corners\"\nMerit 2% for each merit applied (10 merits max for 20% total reduction)\nWSU benefit block (10% total reduction)\nPrincipal position (passive special) in Education Job\nUpgrades\nCompanies have various Upgrades that can be applied to help the company work faster.\nCompany Size\nCompany size upgrades increase the number of employees your company can hold. Each upgrade costs an additional 10% of the initial startup costs and increases the number of employees you can hold by 25% with each upgrade. The final two company size upgrades are only available if the company director has completed\nBUS3130\nCompany Size Upgrades\nSize Cost\nStarting size Startup\n125% startup size 10% of startup cost\n150% startup size 20% of startup cost\n175% startup size 30% of startup cost\n200% startup size 40% of startup cost\n225% startup size 50% of startup cost\n250% startup size 60% of startup cost\nTotal 210% of startup cost\nStaff Room\nStaff Room upgrades help keep your environment at 100%. You need larger staff rooms when you have more employees. The final two staff room upgrades are only available if the company director has completed\nBUS3130\nStaff Room Upgrades\nSize Cost\nNo staff room Startup\nSmall staff room 2.5% of startup cost\nStandard staff room 5% of startup cost\nLarge staff room 7.5% of startup cost\nVery large staff room 10% of startup cost\nHuge staff room 12.5% of startup cost\nColossal staff room 15% of startup cost\nTotal 52.5% of startup cost\nWarehouse\nWarehouses hold inventory.

The respective costs of which would be that of half, equivalent or double that of their respective companies or free if the director had a stock benefit in TGP. The advertising would last for a single week at which point it would have to be re-initiated at the same costs. The purpose of advertising was to increase popularity which caused an increase in profit. Popularity now is merely a marker of performance and has no direct influence on income.\nPrior to the Jan/2014 update, company owners also had to use the 1-5 daily trains (based on company stars) to prevent Efficiency from dropping. Reportedly this is no longer the case. This makes some sense since subsequent to the update, a company can now save up to 20 trains. The company earns trains daily equal to the stars of the company IE a 1* company will get 1 train per day while a 5* will get 5 trains per day. This can be increased by appointing some employees as Trainers.\nFive and ten star companies were added to the game in the weeks following the medical 2.0 update on the 25th Feb 2015.\nAs per Chedburn's bulletin the Private Security Firm bonus 'Regulation' was changed from 10% to 25%.\nAs per Chedburn's comment Job Point limits are now 'per torn day' as opposed to 24 hours.\nMiscellaneous Notes\nCustomer loyalty can be created by having the price of sold products set below RRP. Creating customer loyalty takes years and allows companies to get more customers or sell for higher prices source.\n\nPatch History\nReleased prior to Patch list #1\nItem Market 2.0\nThe Car Dealership and Property Broker 5* specials have been replaced.

        "content": "This Article is currently under Construction or Expansion.\nYou are welcome to assist in its construction. Please direct your questions to the editors or contributors. These can be found here. Alternatively please comment here!\n\nCrimes 2.0 is a major expansion in the works for the Crimes 1.0 system. The update was first announced in September 2012[1] and went live on 20 June 2023. Crimes 2.0 will be put out through a staggered release.\n\nAs of January 22, 2024 new players will now be automatically enrolled into the crimes 2.0 system. [2]\nPlayers who created their accounts before this will still have a choice between migrating to 2.0 or continuing to use the old crime system for some time - however once an account is migrated it will never be able to return to the old system. [3]\nContents\n1 Introduction\n1.1 Crime Categories\n1.2 Outcomes\n1.3 Unique Outcomes\n1.4 Crime Chains and Progression\n2 Crimes\n2.1 Search For Cash\n2.2 Bootlegging\n2.3 Graffiti\n2.4 Shoplifting\n2.5 Pickpocketing\n2.6 Card Skimming\n2.7 Burglary\n2.8 Hustling\n2.9 Disposal\n2.10 Cracking\n2.11 Forgery\n2.12 Scamming\n2.13 Future Crimes\n3 Award Migration\n4 Patch History\n5 References\n\nIntroduction\nAll crimes require Nerve to perform. Successful crimes provide Crime Experience (CE) and Crime Skill (CS), introduced with Crimes 2.0.\nCE is a hidden metric that determines your natural nerve bar (NNB) and influences success rates in Organised Crimes (OCs). It is not specifically tied to a particular crime or OC. Unlike with Crime there is no cap to NNBs, however each increment of 5 is harder to achieve.\nCS is a metric measured in levels, individually for each crime, displayed with a progress bar on each crime page.\nEach crime has a number of subcrimes. By default at level 1 in any given crime, some subcrimes will be available and some subcrimes will be locked. Depending on the subcrime you may be able to unlock it in different ways:\nBy obtaining a special item.\nBy leveling up in the crime.\nFor example, in the \"Search for Cash\" crime, immediately available are the Trash, Subway and Junkyard. The Beach and Cemetery are unlocked by obtaining the Metal Detector and Cemetery Key respectively, and the Fountain is unlocked by reaching level 75 in Search for Cash. It is unknown if Battle Stats or Work Stats affect success rates in the Crimes 2.0 system. [4]\nCrime Categories\nCommitting up to 10,000 crimes in each category will earn you 15 medals per category. 12 crimes are currently divided into six categories.\nTheft: Search For Cash, Shoplifting, Pickpocketing and Burglary\nCounterfeiting: Bootlegging and Forgery\nVandalism: Graffiti\nFraud: Card Skimming, Hustling and Scamming\nIllicit Services: Disposal\nCybercrime: Cracking\nExtortion: no crimes released yet\nIllegal production: no crimes released yet\nOutcomes\nThere are three basic results from doing any crime:\nSuccess: this will provide cash, items or a mix, in addition to some amount of CE and CS.\nFail: these are orange and will provide no reward, but also no loss of CE or CS.\nCritical Fail: these are red and will result in a significant loss of CE and CS (you may notice you drop down an entire level) as well as the possibility of one of the following:\nJail time\nLoss of Life\nHospital time\nItem or money loss\nPenalties specific to the crime, such as losing card details in Card Skimming\nEach outcome also temporarily affects your progression from future crimes - discussed below.\nSuccess rates for each subcrime depend on unique time-dependent factors; for example, a player will have a much higher chance of success doing \"Search the Cemetery\" while the groundskeeper is not on duty. These subcrime success rates can be seen in a tooltip:\nEach Search for Cash crime provides money and/or items as rewards, however it is currently unknown whether this will be the case for every further crime once the system is fully released.\nUnique Outcomes\nCrimes now feature some outcomes that a player can obtain a single time, i.e. \"uniquely\". Unique outcomes may give slightly more valuable rewards, or even special items required by subsequent subcrimes (e.g. finding the Metal Detector is a unique outcome from Search the Junkyard).\nWhen available, unique outcomes are indicated by a star on the subcrime button:\nWhen a unique outcome is triggered, this star will turn gold for a few seconds, and there will be a small delay before you can attempt another crime.\nUnique outcomes are available only when certain conditions are met:\nSome unique outcomes are Crime Skill dependent - if you drop down a level due to a critical fail, you may lose access to a unique outcome.\nSome unique outcomes may be time-dependent based on the same mechanics that govern success rates. For example in the Search the Beach subcrime, there is a unique outcome that is only available at high-tide.\nCrime Chains and Progression\nCrime Progression is a new perk for Crimes 2.0 that increases how much CE and CS you gain with each crime. All preexisting perks with respect to CE have been merged into crime progression, and they are combined additively to provide a total percentage bonus to your CE and CS gains:\n+10% from Criminality Faction upgrades\n+10% from Crime Progression Merit upgrades\n+10% from Education\n+5% from the relevant Crime Enhancer\n+5% from completing the Law starter job\n(up to) +15% from Company specials.\nNote: The Criminality special \"Crimes\" providing a passive bonus to your CE, which can be upgraded from 1 to 25, is still in effect for players that have not yet migrated. On your personal perks page you will see the correct effect description, however until a full rollout of Crimes 2.0 is complete, the Criminality page will still display the old bonus. For Crimes 2.0 players, every bonus past \"Crimes X\" has no effect.\nA Crime Chain is something that builds up slowly as you have more crime successes. Higher chains result in increased CE and CS gains from subsequent successful crimes (all crimes, no matter which crime was used to build the chain).\nA Failure will halve your current crime chain bonus.\nA Critical Failure will zero your current crime chain bonus.\nA Critical Failure will also demoralize you when performing crimes in the future, resulting in reduced CE and CS gains. This effect will wear off gradually with subsequent successful offenses in any crimes.\nCrimes\nSearch For Cash\nRead the main article: Search For Cash for full details on each subcrime.\nSearch for cash is the first type of crime released for Crimes 2.0. It is a Theft crime, with the subcrimes:\nSearch the Trash\nSearch the Subway\nSearch the Junkyard\nSearch the Beach (requires a Metal Detector)\nSearch the Cemetery (requires a Cemetery Key)\nSearch the Fountain (requires level 75 crime skill)\nEnhancer: Glasses\nSearch For Cash has 34 unique outcomes in total.\nNote: It is possible to have a critical fail when attempting search for cash in which you will lose your Glasses enhancer\nBootlegging\nRead the main article:: Bootlegging for full details on each subcrime.\nBootlegging is the second type of crime released for Crimes 2.0.

Once DVDs are made into copied DVDs, they can be sold via the \"Sell counterfeit DVDs\" crime.\n\nEnhancer: High-Speed Drive\nBootlegging has 4 unique outcomes in total.\nNote: It is possible to have a critical fail when copying DVDs in which a player will lose their High-Speed Drive enhancer or PC.\nGraffiti\nRead the main article:: Graffiti for full details on each subcrime.\nGraffiti is the third crime released for Crimes 2.0. It is a Vandalism crime, with the subcrimes:\nEast Side\nWest Side\nNorth Side\nResidental District\nRed-Light District\nFinancial District\nCity Centre\nGraffiti requires players to use spray cans. Spray cans can be added to the crime interface from a player's inventory. The cans are eventually used up and must be replaced.\nGraffiti has five reputation stars for each subcrime. Players will only gain progress towards reputation stars (and the occasional spray can) when first attempting the crime, but cash payouts and unique results are given as a player gets a higher reputation.\nA player's reputation in an area is independent from reputation in other areas. Reputation will decrease slowly over time as authorities cover a player's graffiti.\nEnhancer: Paint Mask\nGraffiti has 41 unique outcomes in total.\nShoplifting\nRead the main article: Shoplifting for full details on each subcrime.\nShoplifting is the fourth crime released for Crimes 2.0. It is a Theft crime, containing eight shops available for shoplifting:\nSally's Sweet Shop\nBits 'n' Bobs\nTC Clothing\nSuper Store\nPharmacy\nCyber Force\nJewelry Store\nBig Al's Gun Shop\nShoplifting does not require any special item currently to conduct the crime, but a Torn City Times will add extra outcomes.\nEvery attempt at shoplifting will increase a player's notoriety in that particular shop. Notoriety gains will depend on the types of successes or failures.\nEach shop features one or two security statuses that may occasionally become disabled. Security statutes being on/off will affect possible outcomes and notoriety gains. It is intended that a player can still succeed with a reasonable success rate, even with high notoriety.\nEnhancer: Mountain Bike\nShoplifting has 55 unique outcomes in total.\nNote: It is possible to have a critical fail when shoplifting in which a player will lose their mountain bike.\nPickpocketing\nRead the main article: Pickpocketing for full details on each subcrime.\nPickpocketing is the fifth crime released for Crimes 2.0. It is a Theft crime.\nThis crime involves players targeting unsuspecting pedestrians for pickpocketing. No additional item necessary.\nThere are 22 mark types, each with a unique outcome.

It is a Fraud crime.\nCard Skimming requires players to use a Card Skimmer and a Spy Camera\nThis crime involves the use of skimmers to acquire credit card details, an a Spy Camera to observe the pin code entered. Once a skimmer has been installed, it will slowly collect details from those who use the ATM. At a time of your choosing, you may then recover your skimmer from the ATM to collect and sell the details contained within. Both items are returned upon the successful recovery of the Skimmer.\nThe longer you leave Card Skimmer and Spy Camera, the chance increases that a player will lose either or both item.\nA player can only have a maximum of 20 concurrent active skimmers.\nEnhancer: Duct Tape\nCard Skimming has 0 unique outcome at the time of the release.\nBurglary\nRead the main article: Burglary for full details on each subcrime.\nBurglary is the seventh crime released for Crimes 2.0.

Players can then optionally case discovered locations to increase their success chance before burglarizing the property. If a player fails a casing or burglary, the property may become too dangerous to attempt again for a short time.\nEach property has a \"recommended\" item that is not required to have, but will increase the rewards pool if a player possesses the corresponding item when attempting to burglarize a property.\nScouted properties will disappear from a player's list if they have not been interacted with for some time and you can have maximum 100 scouted properties available at once.\nEnhancer: Flashlight\nBurglary has 34 unique outcomes, one for each unique burglary target.\nHustling\nRead the main article: Hustling for full details on each subcrime.\nHustling is the eighth crime released for Crimes 2.0.

From here, you can then intentionally lose money to further capture their attention, thus increasing the chance and size of their bets, before you start cashing in on them. When you start winning, the audience members will start getting suspicious, which may prevent them from betting further, or even leaving altogether.\nEnhancer: Megaphone\nHustling has 0 unique outcome at the time of the release.\n\nDisposal\nRead the main article: Disposal for full details on each subcrime.\nDisposal is the ninth crime released for Crimes 2.0.

Additional targets with increasingly advanced passwords and levels of encryption will become available as skill level increases.\nPlayers can initially only use their Computer or Laptop. At level 25, the first of three rig chassis becomes available. Chassis can be equipped with CPU and cooling components to enhance a rig's MIPS. This increases its brute-forcing strength, allowing more characters to be revealed each cycle.\nEnhancer: Office Chair\nCracking has no unique outcomes.\nAn honor bar is available upon achieving level 100 in Cracking.

It should be noted that any amount of donator packs bought at one time between 25 to 9,999 receives the 21% discount.\nFAQ\nWhere do I donate at?\nYou can find the Donator House in the City, or you can click here.\nWho do I talk to if I need help?\nYou can email payments@torn.com for all your Donation issues. You can also mail bogie at 148747 with any issues.\nCan I cancel my subscription?\nYes, you can cancel at any time, you won't lose any subscription status already paid for, it simply won't take a recurring payment.\nWhere can I cancel?\nIf you are subscribed through PayPal then navigate to your PayPal settings - Payments - Manage your automatic payments - Manage funding sources, and you can cancel here. With Amazon, you can simply cancel on the in-game donator house page. With Google, if subscribed via the Android app, open the Google Playstore app, at the top right, tap the profile icon, tap payments and subscriptions - subscriptions, you can cancel here. . If you are still having issues please email payments@torn.com.\nCan I donate using Googleplay?\nYes, however this option is only available through our official Android App.\nI want to make a large purchase, can I get a special discount?\nWe don't offer any special discounts or unique rates to individuals, this way we can ensure everyone is always getting the best and most fair price available. The best discounts are already available on the Donator page itself. Larger purchases on this page will receive the maximum 21% discount, with a further 20% off available for Crypto purchases.\nWhy won't PayPal accept my prepaid debit card?\nGenerally, prepaid debit cards purchased within The U.S. are allowed to be used almost anywhere, however, some of them stipulate the card can only be used within The U.S. Torn is located in England, making the purchase out of the country for these cards, and whilst these may work for donator packs, unfortunately, PayPal and Amazon do not usually accept these for subscriptions.\nWhat Crypto options do you accept?\nThe choices for Crypto can vary depending on what our processing partner, Coingate, accept at the time. You can check available options on the purchase page, and select \"more currencies\" to see a full list available. Some more niche options may only be available for larger purchases.\nWhat does \"Subscription Pending\" mean?\"\nThis normally means your payment did not complete successfully for this month, PayPal will retry that payment in 5 days time. This does mean you may possibly lose the donator status until they retry and complete a successful payment, alternatively, you can cancel and restart it immediately once it expires.\nMy subscription is still not going through, why?\nThis could be a few reasons, but there are a few troubleshooting points to try first. Firstly ensure your chosen payment method (PayPal/Amazon) has 2FA enabled, this is a requirement for online purchases where Torn is located due to Strong Customer Authentication requirements.\nYour bank could also be blocking these payments, since Torn is UK-based, some overseas banks may disallow international payments to the UK, speaking with them may resolve this.\nCertain card types may also be blocked by PayPal or Amazon, commonly this can occur with Maestro or virtual cards as well as pre-paid cards, you may need to use another option.\nIf you are still stuck then please email payments@torn.com and it can be figured out there for you, we may simply need more information about your specific issue.\nWhat if I change my mind or want a refund?\nAs of October 20th 2024 after buying donator packs you have 30 days to request a refund by mailing payments@torn.com, if you have used the donator pack or torn money different things may happen with your account to make it right.\nIf you charge back your purchase you will be put into Federal Jail within the game for questions and to resolve the dispute.\nFurther accurate information can be found within Torn's Rules under section Terms of Supply and any questions about payments or refunds once again can be sent to Bogie at payments@torn.com please give one working business day for reply.\nHistorical Notes\nBefore 3rd of September 2024 donator packs provided 50 points, monthly subscriptions provided 75 points and annual subscriptions provided 900 points.

Addiction effects occur while you have a particular level of addiction - not just while you have a drug cooldown. Every drug you take will provide some addiction (unless you are reading the \"Hot Turkey\" book), even if the Brain icon has not yet appeared. It is important to note that while the terms are often used interchangeably in Torn, \"Addiction\" and \"Battle Stats debuff\" are not the same thing - although this debuff is an easy way to gauge your level of addiction without going to rehab.\nAt a certain level of addiction, the brain icon will appear among your personal icons, indicating the level of debuff to your Battle Stats. The heavier your addiction, the more red the brain will appear.\nAside from a Battle Stats debuff, additional negative consequences will begin to occur as your addiction progresses:\nYour effectiveness within a company will begin to drop (this does not affect directors). This starts from your first drug, not just when the Brain icon has appeared! When you click on your information in your company you will see your addiction amount. Different company types and directors are more strict on keeping addiction levels low.\nYou will be kicked from any education you are enrolled in. While in a faction with maximum Toleration, this occurs around an addiction level that provides 6-7% Battle Stats debuff. This effect can be mitigated working in a 10* Nightclub. It has occasionally happened as low as brain icon 5% when the brain first goes from black to red.\nYou may lose access to the drug-free Gym, the Sports Science Lab. This occurs if your total Xanax and Ecstasy used combines to more than 150.\nYou may be forced to use drugs to be able to access the Gym to train in; if you have high addiction and try to train you may fail to train if you don’t have an active drug icon.\nAlthough rumoured for years, Addiction does not affect Organised Crimes success in any way. [1]\nIt is possible to mitigate the effects of addiction with:\nThe \"Side Effects\" Faction special.\nThe \"Addiction Mitigation\" Merit upgrade.\nIt is possible to remove these long-term effects by:\nGoing to Rehab in Switzerland\nWaiting for the addiction to wear off naturally. 20 Addiction Points are removed naturally each day at 3:30am TCT.\nSpending job points on specials: \"R and R\" in Cruise Line Agency, \"Herbal Cleansing\" in Flower Shop, and \"Suppression\" in Nightclub (all of which are available in 5* companies). 1 Addiction Point is removed per job point.\nUsing Book : Milk Yourself Sober which removes a substantial amount of drug addiction upon completion.\nUsing Book : Hot Turkey to gain no drug addiction 31 days.\nUsing a White Easter Egg which halves current drug addiction, although it does not appear to do the same to the rehab expense.\nMore testing needs to be done before accurate figures can be set on how many of each drug will force an Education kick.\nOverdosing\nAny time a drug is taken (with the exception of Opium and Love Juice, which cannot be overdosed on), there is a small chance to overdose on said drug. When this happens, the player will receive an event saying they have overdosed, and suffer that drug's overdose effects.\nEach drug has a different overdose effect (detailed above) and typically come with an extended drug cooldown. Each drug also has a different chance to overdose (e.g Cannabis has an extremely low OD chance, whereas ecstasy has a relatively high chance)\nAddiction, frequency of drug-taking, number taken, times since last OD, etc, have no impact on the chance to overdose.\nOverdose chance can be reduced with the use of the 'Overdosing' faction upgrade in the Toleration branch, decreasing your chance to OD by 3% per upgrade to a maximum of 30%. It can also be reduced by 50% in a 7* Nightclub with the passive \"Toleration\" special.\nThere is a 1 in 2500 chance of overdosing on cannabis (1 in 500 during the Cannabis Day event)[2] No Faction specials that reduce overdose chances affect Cannabis [3]\nRelated Awards\nThere is a honor bar available for taking 50 of each type of drug (excluding Love Juice) and one for overdosing on Cannabis:\nDrug Related Awards\nImage Name Requirements\nSpaced Out Overdose on Cannabis\nWho's Frank?

The delay will increase the user's personal & faction stats for travel time.\nWhile a player is actively traveling (with the profile status of 'Traveling to/Returning from'), they cannot be attacked. Players in the same country can attack each other, unless the intended target's last action is greater than 168 hours[2], in which case they are \"Hiding out\" and do not appear on the 'People' list of that country. However, players who are \"Hiding out\" can be attacked if they are the intended target of a mission, in which case they will appear at the top of the 'People\" list and highlighted in pink.\nWhen a player is abroad they will be unable to access their inventory.\nPlayers who are hospitalized will have to wait out their hospital time or seek a revive.\nPlayers who work at 5* or above in Logistics Management are able to travel back to Torn even while hospitalized.\nWhen travelling, the movement of Clouds can be toggled by clicking on a Cloud, and holding for approx 2 seconds.\nContents\n1 Laptop\n2 Destinations\n3 Carrying Items\n4 Related Awards\n5 Historical Notes\n6 Patch History\n7 References\nLaptop\nNote: Due to the sidebar being made available while traveling, there's no need to own a Laptop or a PC to access certain features.[3].\nDestinations\nFlights using the WLT benefit are always free.

        "url": "https://wiki.torn.com/wiki/Hunting",
        "content": "Contents\n1 Overview\n2 Hunting skill\n3 Which session?\n4 Tips for hunting\n5 Honors\n6 Further Reading\n7 Patch History\nOverview\nHunting becomes available when you reach level 15; you can then travel to South Africa and use the option to hunt for animals by spending 10 Energy and $500 in the hope of making a profit. There is no time requirement for a hunting session; you get the result immediately after you select the session type.\nThere are 3 types of hunting session: beginner, standard, and advanced session. All three will earn the same amount of hunting skill (and reportedly a bit of leveling experience). The amount of money earned will vary depending on your hunting skill and the session type selected. A higher skill will result in more animals being killed and sold. A higher session opens up additional animals to be hunted, although it appears certain minimum skill levels are required before any animal of a given type will be killed. For example, a hunting skill in the low 40's can get you giraffes and cheetahs, but catching other animals in the standard session is very unlikely. The session types and animal rewards are as follows:\nBeginner sessions allow you to hunt only the following animals:\nBuffalo - $250 each\nZebra - $350 each\nBaboon - $500 each\nWarthog - $400 each\nStandard sessions allow you to hunt all the Beginner animals, plus the following:\nGiraffe - $1,000 each\nCheetah - $2,000 each\nHippo - $3,000 each\nLeopard - $2,500 each\nAdvanced sessions allow you to hunt all the Beginner and Standard animals, (some for more money) plus the following:\nGiraffe - $1,500 each\nHippo - $4,500 each\nLion - $5,000 each\nRhino - $8,500 each\nElephant - $12,000 each\nHyena - $3,000 each\nGorilla - $4,500 each\nTiger - $20,000 each\nAdvanced sessions during the World Tiger Day Event allow you to hunt all the Beginner, Standard and Advanced animals plus the following:\nAddax - $850,000 each\nPangolin -$1,400,000 each\nCape Vulture - $2,800,000 each\nWhite Tiger - $5,000,000 each\nHunting skill\nTo get your hunting skill from 0 to 100 will take a lot of time (about 164,000 energy, which can be reduced by 25% with a 7* Meat Warehouse), and you will most likely lose out on a lot of Battle Stats. You start off at 1 hunting skill, and you begin with 1.0 for the very first hunt. However, as your hunting skill rises your skill gain per session will fall in an exponential relationship. For example, with a hunting skill of around 40, you will gain only roughly 0.025 per session and at skill 99 you gain 0.0003 per session.\nWhich session?\nGenerally, when hunting, you should start off with the beginner session. It will become more profitable to move on to standard sessions when your hunting skill reaches the mid-twenties.\nIt will become more profitable to move from standard to advanced sessions when your hunting skill reaches the mid-seventies.\nAt maximum skill, you should be making about 800K per full energy bar (if you are a donator). However, this will take a long time, and is a poor strategy for active players.\nTips for hunting\nIt's highly advisable to have donator status when hunting; the higher maximum energy and quicker regeneration time will help out greatly.\nIt may be advisable to work in a Farm or Zoo; each has a 3-star hunting special which will give an additional 25% income when hunting.\nFaction perk 'Hunting (Secondary tree perk in Excursion branch)' can increase hunting income up to 30%. (3% per upgrade)\nAnother way to boost profits is to complete the General Education course GEN 2120 Survival Skills, which gives a further boost of 15% to hunting income.\nIf you are flower running or otherwise making only a short visit, be sure to spend your extra energy here before returning to Torn. The 3h 37min trip back (with an Airstrip) will generate 105-110 energy, so if you spend your energy down to 40 before leaving South Africa you will gain a little income from hunting and still should reach full energy (for a donator) close to the time you arrive back in Torn.\nHunting exp is increased by x5 on International Tiger Day Event (July 28th 12:00 TCT to July 30th 12:00 TCT), each year. Additionally some more valuable animals are temporarily available for the duration of the event.\nFinally, if you plan to be away hunting for an extended time, it may be helpful to bank your money so that it may generate interest while you hunt.\nHonors\nThere are three honor bars associated with the hunting skill.\n- Achieve 50 skill in hunting\n- Achieve 75 skill in hunting\n- Achieve 100 skill in hunting\nFurther Reading\nHunting Skill, The Complete Guide +World Tiger Day\n\nPatch History\nReleased prior to Patch list #1\nPatch list #366 : 17/12/2024\nChanged Hunting skill to start at 1 rather than 0 (which also looked a bit glitchy upon the first hunting session)\nPatch list #202 : 27/07/21\nRefactored very old Hunting system code and added World Tiger Day mini-event.\nPatch list #182 : 02/03/21\nChanged racing and hunting to always show two decimal places for consistency (excluding personal stats).\nPatch list #106 : 13/08/19\nAdded \"Back\" link to the Hunting page.\nPatch list #71 : 27/11/18\nChanged rounding of hunting skill gain to 4 decimal places."

Both intended spouses and the witness must be in Torn for the ceremony.\nThe Ring\nYou can obtain a ring through several different means:\nA purchase from the Item Market\nA purchase from the Jewelry Shop\nSuccessfully performing a four-nerve crime in Crimes 1.0, Shoplift a Jewelry Store\nSucceed in various crimes like Shoplifting or Burglary in Crimes 2.0.\nNote that shoplifting may return a watch, necklace or ring, and there is a high risk of being jailed.\nThere are currently four rings that can be used for proposals: Diamond Ring, Gold Ring, Sapphire Ring, and Plain Silver Ring. See the Jewelry Store for more details on rings.\nThe Proposal\nAfter acquiring a ring, you can propose to someone by going to the ring in your inventory and selecting \"use\" from item actions. This will prompt you to enter the name of the intended spouse.\nThe person to whom you've proposed will receive an event and have an option to Accept / Reject your proposal. Once the proposal has been accepted, the marriage status of both players changes to \"Engaged\".\nShould you wish to cancel a proposal to another player you can do so by going to the church and clicking \"View Proposals\".\nIf a proposal has been accepted, and you then wish to cancel the engagement, go to the Church, click Ceremony, then click Second Thoughts.\nThe Witness\nYou may invite more than one person to witness your wedding, though you are only required to have one. To obtain a witness, you must both visit the Church after you are engaged. Here you will each have the option to add witnesses. The witnesses must be selected off of your Friends list, and the witness must accept the request in order to be considered a valid witness. Players who are traveling, in hospital or in jail cannot accept.\nNote: After accepting the request, the witness receives an event suggesting that they send a wedding gift to the happy couple.\nThe Ceremony\nBefore the ceremony concludes at the Church , you each have to profess your marriage vows. This can be a sincere message or you can simply enter some filler text. Any entry will suffice. Once this has been done you can complete the marriage by clicking the 'kiss' button. Each spouse will then have their marriage status changed to \"Newlywed\".\nDivorce\nTo end a marriage, either player may divorce the other. You may not divorce until you have been married for at least 7 days. Divorces are granted by going to the City and visiting the Church.\nIf your spouse is living in your property, you must kick them out before being able to divorce them. Likewise, if you are living in your spouse's property, you must leave it before being able to divorce them.\nBenefits\nOne of the benefits of marriage is the ability to share a property. Either player may move into a property owned or rented by the other player. However, the owner of the property has the ability to kick his or her spouse out of that property. Your spouse may not kick you from a property that you own.\nFor properties with a vault, vault sharing was introduced on 29/09/2015. The owner of a property may choose to share or not to share their vault with their spouse (the default is not shared). The logs for all withdrawals and deposits can be viewed in the vault's 'Recent vault transactions' section. Spouses are unable (by default, can be changed) to access vaults on other properties.\nRelated Awards\nHonors and Medals can be earned by staying married to the same person for increasing amounts of time.\nBelow is a list of Marriage related honor bars;\nExpand\nMarriage related honors\nA list of marriage related medals can be found here\nBugs\nAn issue is sometimes caused with your account stating that you are already proposing to someone when you are not. If this is the case, then submit a Bug Report and wait for a staff member to fix the issue for you!\nIt is unknown whether or not this has been fixed with the release of RESPO.\nHistorical Notes\nThe Church was added on 23 June 2014 (Respo update) which changed the way you get married.\nBack to Top"

Merits can be earned in many ways (e.g. achieving a certain level, stat point, number of attacks, etc.) and can also be bought at the points building for 300 points. There is a limit on the amount of merits that can be bought; one merit can be bought for every 2 levels you upgrade, leading to a maximum of 50 merits that can be bought at level 100.\nMerits can be reset for a cost of points. The first reset costs 500 points with each subsequent reset costing an additional 250 points (ie 750 for the second, 1000 for the third).

These resets can be used whenever you want, but must be used before being able to purchase one with points. Using a free merit reset will not increase the points cost as it would for purchasing one, and will remain the same as it was--these do stack.\nFree merit reset can be obtained upon completion of the Book : High School For Adults.\nFree merit resets have been awarded to all users every year since 2018 as part of seasonal Christmas gift.\nSometimes on special occasion a free merit reset may be awarded by game admins due to extenuating circumstances.\nUpgrades\nMerits are used to gain bonuses, all of which are incremental (price increases by 1 merit after every upgrade) and you can upgrade them up to 10 times, at a cost of 55 merits in total.\nFighting Stats\nYou can spend merits to give you a passive bonus to Battle Stats (3% per upgrade).

        "content": "Contents\n1 Nerve\n2 Increasing Your Maximum Nerve Bar\n3 Refilling your Nerve bar\n4 References\nNerve\nNerve is a crucial attribute for many activities in the game, especially committing Crimes. It recovers at a rate of 1 nerve every 5 minutes until it reaches the maximum capacity of your nerve bar. You can also boost your nerve recovery by using Drugs, drinking Alcohol, spending 30 Points for a refill, getting the Herbal Releaf Co. Stock benefit, exchanging treats with 'Cold Sweat' basket upgrade during Trick or Treat event, or spending job points on nerve. Your natural maximum nerve grows along with your crime experience. You can further expand your nerve bar by up to 65 with all the bonuses: merit upgrades, company specials and faction specials. However, only your natural nerve bar reflects your crime experience.\nNerve is a resource that is needed for committing Crimes, which are illegal activities that can earn money, items, or other benefits. The difficulty and reward of Crimes vary depending on the amount of nerve required.\nThe natural nerve bar (NNB) is determined by the crime experience of the player, which reflects their ability to perform harder Crimes.\nNerve can also be used for Busting, which is the action of freeing oneself or another player from Jail. Jail is a place where players are sent after failing a Crime or being arrested by another player. Busting oneself costs half of the total nerve bar, while Busting another player costs five nerve. The success rate of Busting depends on the level, bust skill, and other factors of the player.\nYou can reduce the cost of nerve of busting yourself out of Jail by having completed education LAW2990. Busting skill can be increased by up to 50% with the use of Bust skill upgrades on the Criminality branch of faction specials.\nNerve is not consumed by participating in Faction Organized Crimes, which are large-scale criminal operations that require coordination and planning among faction members. Organized Crimes can yield high rewards, but also carry high risks and require high crime experience and natural nerve bar.\nWhen a player has more Nerve than their maximum, Nerve will neither reset to the player's maximum like Happy does, nor will it increment on the 5 minute mark.\nThere is an internal cap in the system for current nerve of 32,767 -- that is, even if a player uses drugs or alcohol, any nerve gained beyond 32,767 will be discarded. [1].\nIncreasing Your Maximum Nerve Bar\nThe main way to increase your nerve bar is through doing Crimes; this both increases your crime experience and at certain milestones of CE also increases your nerve bar size by increments of 5. These points are often referred to as your \"natural nerve bar\".\nSpending Merits on your nerve bar allows you to increase your maximum nerve bar by up to 10 extra points.\nJoining a Faction with the Nerve Faction upgrades in the Criminality branch. Nerve increases your nerve bar by 1 per Nerve upgrade (up to a maximum of 40).\nMany Job and Company specials can provide bonuses to your nerve:\nThe 5* Amusement Park special \"Unflinching\" gives user +10 maximum nerve.\nThe 5* Meat Warehouse special \"Carnage\" gives user +10 maximum nerve.\nThe 10* Pub special \"Buzzed\" gives user +15 maximum nerve.\nNerve bar size and crime experience are also increased by busting others out of jail. It is unclear exactly how busting higher levels or longer jail times affects that.\nThere is no limit to one's maximum natural nerve, although each increment will be harder to achieve (125 was the limit in the old system with 60 Natural Nerve Bar + 10 Merit upgrades + 40 Faction special + 15 from 10* Pub Special).

It was added on 1 March 2007. [1]\nA Car and a Racing License are required before players can use the Race Track. The Racing License can be purchased at the Points Building for 50 points.\nOfficial Races\nThere is no fee to take part in official races. Players will automatically be paired with five other racers in the same racing class. Official races will take 1 hour to be prepared, and will finish once all participants have crossed the finish line.\nAfter leaving an official race, there is a 15 minute penalty time before you can join another official race.\nCustom Races\nPlayers can create custom racing event. While no racing points are earned in custom events, players will earn driver skill. Unlike official races there is no waiting period to join or create a new custom race after leaving one. An entry fee can be added, with winnings going to the top three finishers.\nThe following options need to be selected to start a custom race:\nRace name.\nDrivers required. (Max 6)\nMaximum drivers. (Max 100)\nTrack.\nNumber of Laps. (Max 100)\nCars Allowed. Restrict entries to a certain class, or a single car.\nUpgrades Allowed.

Racing Points obtained through Company specials do not count towards ranking up a class; only points earned from Racing count.\nRacing Skill\nRacing skill is gained every race, whether official or custom.\nOwning the Torn City Motors Stock benefit block passively gives a 10% boost to racing skill.\nLonger track length and a better race end position give higher racing skill gains.\nCar type and race time has no effect on racing skill gains.\nOfficial races will give more racing skill compared to custom races of similar length to compensate for the longer wait times before the race starts.\nRacing Skill is capped at 100\nTrack List\nThere are a total of 16 tracks. Some tracks will not be accessible until you reach a certain class.\nTrack List\nName Image Length\nUptown 2.25mi\nWithdrawal 3.4mi\nUnderdog 1.73mi\nParkland 3.43mi\nDocks 3.81mi\nCommerce 1.09mi\nTwo Islands 2.71mi\nIndustrial 1.35mi\nVector 1.16mi\nMudpit 1.06mi\nHammerhead 1.16mi\nSewage 1.5mi\nMeltdown 1.2mi\nSpeedway 0.9mi\nStone Park 2.08mi\nConvict 1.64mi\nNaming a Car\nPlayers can give enlisted cars a unique name to make them more easily identifiable. This can be done by selecting the small pencil icon next to each enlisted car, typing the desired name into the edit box, and clicking on \"save\".\nHonors\nThere are six honor bars that can be achieved by participating in Racing.\n- Reach Class A\n- 250 wins in the same car\n- Achieve a driver skill of 10\n- Crash during a race\n- Win 100 races\n- Earn 2,500 Racing Points\nMiscellaneous Notes\nPlayers cannot travel while currently in a race.\nPlayers can only take part in one race at a time.\nBeing hospitalized during a race will not influence the outcome.\nCars can be bought from The Docks in the City, or from other players in the Item Market or Bazaars. Cars can also be obtained by performing the Grand Theft Auto crimes on the Crimes 1.0 system if you have not migrated to Crimes 2.0.\nAfter a race is finished, it can be replayed in the race log (linked in the completion event) to watch a replay. This can be sped up by x2, x4, x8, x10, x20, x40, x80, and x100.\nPlayers cannot enlist a car that is in a class higher than their class rating, but can use cars below their current class.\nUpgrades cannot be removed after they have been purchased and fitted. Upgrades can only be removed by purchasing a replacement upgrade (i.e. Adjustable Spoiler/Fixed Spoiler).\nRemoving a car from enlistment will remove all upgrades from it and return the stock vehicle to the inventory.\nWrecking a car also has the chance to remove fitted upgrades.\nUltimate Racing Tournament\nTwice a year, the Ultimate Racing Tournament (URT) is held to test players' racing skill and luck, with the winner receiving a Bugatti Veyron and Gold Racing Trophy.\nHistorical Notes\nRacing was originally limited to two tracks. The \"Drag\" course was for one-on-one races that lasted 15 minutes. The \"Round Track\" course was for challenging four other racers and lasted 5 minutes. [2]\nRaces could not be watched- winners were decided based on car stats and luck. Participants would receive an event announcing the race's winner. A sample event:\nPlayer lost to you in a drag race by a few seconds. You have won the pot of $20,000.\nOnly four races could happen on either track at a time.\nReleased prior to Patch list #1\nPatch list #184 : 16/03/21\nAdded value of enlisted cars within the racing system to networth statistics.\nPatch list #182 : 02/03/21\nChanged racing and hunting to always show two decimal places for consistency (excluding personal stats).\nPatch list #181 : 23/02/21\nChanged custom racing bets to pay out as bank checks rather than direct to wallet.\nPatch list #175 : 12/01/21\nAdded gold flare to races created by official URT stewards.\nPatch list #152 : 28/07/20\nChanged opacity of race status panel that appears over the map to make the text clearer.\nPatch list #149 : 07/07/20\nAdded race start time column to the custom races list on Racing.\nPatch list #144 : 02/06/20\nRemoved car selection confirmation when join official race.\nPatch list #133 : 17/03/20\nChanged racing car list order to the sum of all combined stats descending.\nChanged official racing car selection to show track name at the top.\nChanged official races to select the car at the top of the list automatically by default in the background.\nPatch list #118 : 19/11/19\nAdded new racing category with 4 stats into personal stats.\nPatch list #116 : 05/11/19\nChanged custom race creation queries for better security.\nPatch list #109 : 03/09/2019\nChanged racing time formatting in events, statistics and in-race lists.\nPatch list #101 : 09/07/19\nChanged racing car removal confirmation font color to red in an attempt to stop people deleting their own cars.\nPatch list #93 : 14/05/19\nAdded the ability to remove cars from the racing system that have had racing points spent on them.\nPatch list #89 : 09/04/19\nAdded 'new personal best lap' notification to racing result events.\nPatch list #88 : 02/04/19\nRebuilt class banners in the \"Torn City Raceway\" page.\nPatch list #82 : 19/02/19\nChanged \"Start a custom race\" button to appear at the top of the page.\nPatch list #78 : 22/01/19\nAdded spectator mode for custom races.\nIncreased maximum wait time for custom races.\nPatch list #55 : 07/08/18\nChanged password fields in RR and racing to simple text.\nPatch list #49 : 26/06/18\nAdded race replay on racing log page.\nPatch list #47 : 12/06/18\nAdded racing log page (linked from event).\nChanged enlisted cars order in racing to Class descending.\nPatch list #41 : 17/04/18\nAdded list of racing upgrades lost in events received after crashing.\nPatch list #19 : 10/11/17\nChanged racing cars 'top speed' formula for car comparability.\nPatch list #17 : 24/10/17\nUpdated race statistics to show only unique users in global records.\nReferences\n↑ Wollongong, Racing at the Torncity Racetrack (02/03/07)\n↑ Wollongong, Racing at the Torncity Racetrack (02/03/07)\nCity\nWest Side Education · Your Gym · Travel agency\nNorth Side Auction House · Church · Item Market · Points Building · Points Market\nRed-Light Casino · Dump · Loan Shark · Missions · Raceway\nResidential Your Property\nCity Center Chronicle Archives · City Hall · Community Center · Hospital · Jail · Museum · Player Committee · Staff · Visitor Center\nFinancial Bank · Donator House · Messaging Inc · Stock Market\nEast Side Big Al's Gun Shop · Bits 'n' Bobs · Cyber Force · Docks · Estate Agents · Jewelry Store · Nikeh Sports · Pawn Shop · Pharmacy · Post Office · Print Store · Recycling Center · Super Store · Sweet Shop · TC Clothing · Token Shop"

        "title": "Stock Market",
        "url": "https://wiki.torn.com/wiki/Stock_Market",
        "content": "The stock market is where you can buy and sell shares in a variety of stocks, for investing in benefit blocks or speculative trading.\nContents\n1 Stock Trading\n1.1 Getting Started\n1.2 Buying and Selling\n1.3 Stock Prices\n2 Stock Benefits\n2.1 Summary Table\n2.2 Additional Benefits Description\n3 Patch History\n4 References\nStock Trading\nGetting Started\nIn order to use the stock market you must first own a Stock Ticker. This can be purchased for 50 Points from the Points Building.\nThe stock market can be accessed via the URL: https://www.torn.com/page.php?sid=stocks\nIf you own any shares in any stock, you will also have the stock market icon displayed in your Information panel, with a direct link to the stock market.\nBuying and Selling\nTo buy or sell shares in a particular stock, click on the cell in the \"Owned\" column. This will open up a panel where you can buy and sell shares, as well as a table of data regarding your current purchases.\nThere are no limits to how many shares you can purchase, sell or own at any one time. Buying and selling shares is an instantaneous process, although if you attempt to do so while prices are updating it may take a few (~10) seconds before asking you to confirm the order again with the new share price.\nBuying doesn't come with any tax.\nSelling shares comes with a fee of 0.1% of the total value you sell. For example, if you sell $1,000,000 in total value, a fee of $1,000 is taken. This fee was waived between 06/04/21 and 20/04/21.\nYou can sell individual purchases via the link in the purchase history table, alternatively you can also input the number of shares to sell in the input field above this table.\nPurchases can be merged into a single \"position\"; doing this will average all of the data, including \"Bought price\", \"Bought date\", \"Profit\" and \"Change\".\nStocks cannot be bought or sold while in hospital, jail or traveling.\nStocks cannot be traded directly between players. Since shares are bought and sold instantaneously, there is no longer a requirement for P2P trading. All stocks will be bought and sold via the stock market.\nThe profits, losses, and fees paid are included in the personal stats under 'investments' heading. 'Profits/losses received' are not inclusive of 'fees paid'. This information is not visible to others.\nStock Prices\nRegarding the prices of the stocks, Chedburn made the following comments.[1]\nPrice movements are now every minute (instead of every 15 minutes) and are based on real-world stocks in the same industries as Torn's; we won't be able to provide any more information than this.\nStock prices are expected to increase by an average of 10% per year; however, there are no guarantees. Some stocks can be incredibly volatile, doubling within a month or crashing significantly.\nStock Benefits\nStock Benefits come in two types: \"Passive\" or \"Active\".\nPassive benefits require owning the correct number of shares for 7 days before the benefit activates. Active benefits pay out dividends every 7 or 31 days.\nIt is possible to own multiple \"increments\" of each Active benefit stock. Every successive increment costs double that of the previous increment.\nFor example, a benefit block of FHG costs 2,000,000 shares - paying out 1 FHC every 7 days. This means the second increment costs 4,000,000 shares (for a total of 6,000,000) - paying out a second FHC every 7 days, and the third increment costs 8,000,000 shares (for a total of 14,000,000) - paying out a third FHC every 7 days.\nIf you currently have time progression toward an Active benefit dividend, purchasing additional increments will not reset this progression. Instead, progression will continue for the previous amount owned until the dividend is ready, and after this time progression will begin toward multiple increments.\nFor example: You have 1 increment of FHG and have owned it for 3 days. You then purchase 2 more increments. After 4 days, you will receive 1 FHC. At this point progression begins again and after 7 days you will receive 3 FHCs.\nActive benefits cannot be stored and must be claimed before any time progression can be made toward another. This means that if you are currently receiving 1 FHC per week, you cannot go inactive for 2 weeks and collect 2 FHC. Progression toward a benefit works on a daily cron at midnight, meaning there is a 24 hours window in which to collect dividends before any time progression toward the next dividend is lost.\nSince Energy is capped at 1,000 and Happiness is capped at 99,999, collecting a dividend that would result in going beyond these limits will waste this dividend. Thus purchasing more than 10 MCS increments will waste energy every 7 days.\nOnce a dividend is available to collect you will receive the following event: “A stock dividend from X is now available for withdrawal from the Stock Exchange.”\nSummary Table\nStock Benefits\nName Acronym Shares Type Frequency Benefit\nAlcoholics Synonymous ASS 1,000,000 Active 7 days 1x Six Pack of Alcohol\nBig Al's Gun Shop BAG 3,000,000 Active 7 days 1x Ammunition Pack\nCrude & Co CNC 7,500,000 Active 31 days $80,000,000\nEaglewood Mercenary EWM 1,000,000 Active 7 days 1x Box of Grenades\nEmpty Lunchbox Traders ELT 5,000,000 Passive -- 10% Home Upgrade Discount\nEvil Ducks Candy Corp EVL 100,000 Active 7 days 1000 Happy\nFeathery Hotels Group FHG 2,000,000 Active 7 days 1x Feathery Hotel Coupon\nGrain GRN 500,000 Active 31 days $4,000,000\nHerbal Releaf Co.

        "content": "A Territory is a part of the Torn city map that may be owned and controlled by Factions. While territories are owned by a faction they provide a small amount of daily respect in addition to any relevant Racket proceeds.\n\nContents\n1 Claiming Territory\n1.1 Cooldowns\n2 The City Map\n3 Territory Warfare\n4 Control\n5 Trivia\n6 Patch History\n7 References\nClaiming Territory\nTo claim a territory, Factions first must make their presence known in the outskirts of the city (sector 7). From there, Factions can claim and assault adjacent blocks.\nWhen the assaulting faction has no territories to start with, it can start only one assault on any sector 7 block. If a sector 7 faction lost all its territories while participating in multiple wars simultaneously, the other wars (assaulting) can still be continued even when they were over the blocks deeper into the map (sector 6 or so).\n\nCooldowns\nThere are multiple cooldowns in place when it comes to claiming a territory, based on your faction's recent activity.\nIf you abandon or lose (via war) your \"last\" or only territory, you must wait 72 hours before starting again and claiming a territory in Sector 7.\nIf you lose a war on a particular territory, you may not initiate another assault on this territory until 72 hours have passed since your defeat.\nIf you have warred a particular territory at all in the last 90 days, you are subject to an additional cooldown: you may not war this territory within 72 hours of any other war on this territory -- even wars not involving your faction.\nThe City Map\nThe city map becomes a vital part of the territory update. If you click on the city, it will now show you the territories your faction owns as well as other nearby territories. Territories occupied by a faction are shaded with a random predetermined color, while unclaimed territories appear gray. If you want to see the entire territory map, there is a toggle switch below the map to enable this.\nTo see further details on a territory, clicking on a territory brings up an interface with the following details:\nName - The ID of the territory\nSector - The zone the territory is in\nSize - Overall size of the territory.\nDensity - What exists inside the territory. (e.g. buildings, empty)\nSlots - How many player slots the territory has for territory war.\nDaily respect - The amount of respect the territory generates per day if held by a faction.\nIf the territory is currently being assaulted, the interface will also display basic war information, like how many people are participating and how close it is to victory.\nIn your faction there is also a new tab called Territory you can click on, this will display a zoomed-in version of the map, with only your faction highlighted and some additional information at the side. Faction news regarding your territories should also be listed there.\n\nTerritory Warfare\nWhen a territory is assaulted, a wall will appear, the size of which depends on the type of territory (between 5 and 30). This wall will automatically populate with the strongest available defenders from the defending faction.\nTo knock people off of the wall, you must remove them by forcing them from the 'Okay' status (i.e. hospital or jail). If you are not initially on the wall when you knock someone off via combat, you automatically replace the opponent. If you are on the wall when you knock someone off via combat, you reserve the spot for your faction members for 60 seconds (the opposing faction can't jump back onto the spot). Anyone can see a faction's wall, but outside interference leaves emptied slots reserved to the victim faction for 60 seconds.\nIf a spot is empty you can also join that at a cost of 5 energy.\nEvery second a user spends on the wall provides a score of 1 for their faction - for the assaulting faction, this will go towards a goal of 50,000 * wall slots (between 250,000 and 1,500,000), for defenders this will reduce the overall score back towards 0. If the score goal is not obtained by the assaulting team within 72 hours the territory assault will fail.[1]\nTo forcibly end an assault, peace treaties can be used to settle the assault as a truce, this is done through a trade conducted between members of each faction with territory permissions.\nYou must have at least 10 members to assault or claim territory, and room in your faction upgrades to do so. Multiple different territories can be under your assault.\nAfter losing or abandoning your final territory, a cooldown of 72 hours is imposed before claiming a new territory again.[2]\nControl\nFactions can control a certain amount of territories based on their faction upgrades (up to 17). While the territory is under a faction's control, they gain a small amount of daily respect, depending on the territory stats.\nIf the territory is a Territory Racket, it also supplies a daily resource to the faction (with its daily respect). Rackets spawn at Level 1 and will occasionally level up or down between Level 1 and Level 5 (maximum). If a Racket de-levels below Level 1 it will despawn from the map.\nMain article: Racket\nTrivia\nTerritory wars have a max duration of three days\nThe fastest time you can claim victory on a territory is 14 hours.\n\nPatch History\nReleased in Patch list #2\nPatch list #183 : 09/03/21\nAdded clear red warning when a faction is about to abandon its final territory.\nAdded 72 hour cooldown to claim or war territory again after abandoning or losing final one.\nPatch list #177 : 26/01/21\nAdded display of territory wall slot timer for the faction able to take it.\nChanged 'Full Territory View' on the City Map to default to off instead of on.\nPatch list #151 : 21/07/20\nAdded 5 energy usage for joining an empty slot on a territory wall.\nPatch list #143 : 26/05/20\nAdded Faction & Territory search tool to the City Map.\nPatch list #138 : 21/04/20\nChanged contested territories so they will not split the territorial integrity of a faction.\nPatch list #137 : 14/04/20\nImplemented new territory connections algorithm for better quality automated links.\nPatch list #135 : 31/03/20\nAdded visible territory connections when blocks are selected on the City Map.\nPatch list #131 : 03/03/20\nChanged visibility of rackets on the city map to only show if the territory is also shown / loaded.\nPatch list #122 : 17/12/19\nAdded territory cooldown data to the territory tooltip on the City Map\nPatch list #121 : 10/12/19\nRemoved an old territory war cooldown (7 days) when claiming an available territory\nPatch list #119 : 26/11/19\nAdded system to prevent members from joining a territory wall if they joined the faction after the war started\n[API] Added raid and territory war information to 'faction' > 'basic' selection\nPatch list #111 : 17/09/19\nAdded exceptions to the bounty block for new players - if they are in a raid / on a territory war wall\nPatch list #110 : 10/09/19\nAdded territories count & link to see them on the map to faction profiles\nChanged full map mode to become enabled when attempting to use the territory tools on the city map\nPatch list #109 : 03/09/19\nReleased Territory Rackets\nPatch list #84 : 05/03/19\nChanged territory wall removal to be upon receiving hospital time rather than defeat before selection option\nPatch list #78 : 22/01/19\nChanged territory war cooldown system to prevent 'deadlocks' new system\nPatch list #71 : 27/11/18\n[API] Added territorynews, chainnews and crimenews selections to faction category\nPatch list #48 : 19/06/18\nAdded territory war 'assaulting / defending' icon\nPatch list #39 : 03/04/18\nAdded ability to join territorial war from faction profile page\nAttacking respect & Chaining 2.0 released\nWar attacks: Any war-related attack (such as removing a target during a territorial war) will yield a x2 bonus.\nPatch list #3 : 04/07/17\nAdded territorial war arrow animation to the wall\nPatch list #2 : 27/06/17\nReleased changes to territory warring system:\nNo more energy cost simply for joining a wall.\nThe two individual faction walls have been merged into a single one, fought over by both factions.\nAll slots on the single wall are open to either faction involved.\nSuccessful attacks on opponents that are on the wall result in you replacing them.\nRemoving opponents from the wall while you're on it will reserve that slot for your faction for 60 seconds.\nOutsider attacks result in a short slot cooldown of 60s, during which it can be reclaimed by faction.\nTerritory wall view is now available to outside spectators again.\nThe amount of available wall slots varies depending on territory size, between 5 and 30.\nScore requirement for winning depends on the number of slots (50,000 per slot).\nAt the beginning of a war, the strongest available defenders will be auto-joined.\nUsers on the wall now have their points gained during that session displayed.\nUsers on the wall now have their icons displayed (on desktop).\nSlots now have a set order which doesn't change.\nTerritories Beta - War mechanic changes\n'tug of war' style\nTerritories Beta - Challenge\nConceding was disabled during the beta, due to an easy form of abuse, so once you're in a fight for territory there is no way to back out!\nTerritorial Warfare & Upgrade trees - Details\nDetails of the territory war to come\nTerritory - Open beta\nLimited mechanics, primarily testing the map itself and the activity levels to follow\n\nReferences\n↑ Chedburn, Territory warfare changes (27/06/17).\n↑ Chedburn, Patch list #183 (09/03/21).\n\nPart of a series on Factions\nRespect Chaining · Organized Crimes\nWarring Territory · Rackets · Raiding · Ranked Warring · Outside Hits\nManagement Upgrades · Recruit Status"

The new city map has completely revolutionized the way in which users interact with the city, whether it be through item finds or accessing other areas of the game.\nView Chedburn's announcement on the release of the city map here.\nYou can find information on the city prior to the release of RESPO here.\nCity Map\nPreviously, the city was a complete wall of text, with no images. However, the release of RESPO completely changed that incorporating a fully interactive map in its stead. The city map is the foundation for the future of faction warfare, where factions fight over the city map to occupy certain areas.\nThe city map has been custom built from the ground up with the vision of future missions and faction warfare in mind.\nTerritories\nWith the release of Territories factions can now claim parts of the city to earn daily respect. Each faction's territory is viewable on the city map and there are 5 different options under the zoom tools to view how the city is divided:\nView territory: territories are shown separated by who owns them\nView block racket: view details of rackets and the associated blocks\nView block sector: view territories by what sector they are in; there are 7 sectors\nView block density: view territories by daily respect given with green being the lowest and red being the highest\nView block size: view by size\nTerritory Rackets are criminal enterprises which occasionally spawn on random territories.\n\nEach block has a base respect of 15 and has multipliers based on its sector, size, and density listed below:\nSector Size Density\n1 x2.50 (Central) x1.00 (Very small territory) (Smallest 5%) x1.00 (Empty fields)\n2 x2.25 x1.25 (Small territory) (Second smallest 20%) x2.00 (Buildings)\n3 x2.00 x1.50 (Medium territory) (Middle sized 50%) x3.00 (Landmark)\n4 x1.75 x1.75 (Large territory) (Second largest 20%)\n5 x1.50 x2.00 (Very large territory) (Largest 5%)\n6 x1.25\n7 x1.00\nBy default, the full territory view is disabled. There is an option to turn it on under the map.\nFinding Items\nPrior to the RESPO release, you were able to find items solely by visiting the city link, however, this has since been changed. In order to find items, you must physically search the city map by zooming in and clicking on an item if it appears on the map.\nThere is a possibility that: Once a day, at midnight (TCT), one or more items may spawn\nFor more information see Awareness\nDaily Items Allowance\nEvery player has the ability to purchase a maximum of 100 items per day from the shops in the City's East Side. Once this allowance has been used, no further items can be purchased in the East Side until the next Torn new-day, when the allowance is refreshed. Any attempt to buy extra items receives a \"You cannot purchase more than 100 items per day.\" message. (This is unconnected to the Item Market/Bazaars where there are no limitations to the number of purchases.)\nCity and Dirty Bombs\nWhen a Dirty Bomb is activated, several parts of the city are temporarily closed (Airport & all of the East side -except the Estate Agents and Token Shop)\nQuick Links\nFor those who are still unable to get to grips with the city map there is an option to select the quick links at the city, this is somewhat similar to the old city, however, it is missing a few links that were available prior to the release of RESPO.\nWest Side: Education / Your Gym / Travel Agency\nNorth Side: Auction House / Church / Item Market / Points Building / Points Market\nRed-Light: Casino / Dump / Loan Shark / Missions / Race Track\nResidential: Your House\nCenter: Chronicle Archives / City Hall / Committee / Community Center / Hospital / Jail / Museum / Staff / Visitor Center\nFinancial: Bank / Donator House / Msg Inc / Stock Exchange\nEast Side: Big Al's Gun Shop / Bits 'n' Bobs / Cyber Force / Docks / Estate Agents / Jewelry Store / Nikeh Sports / Pawn Shop / Pharmacy / Post Office / Print Store / Recycling Center/ Super Store / Sweet Shop / TC Clothing / Token Shop\nNote: Some areas are unlocked from leveling or completing certain education courses\nRemoved Links\nTo compare the current city to the old city layout click here.\nMost notably the \"Ask A Question\" feature hasn't been linked into RESPO, and the help.php has since been removed. Staff can still be contacted directly via mail or personal message.\nThe Notebook can be now be accessed by donators via a button at the bottom right of their chat bar.\nThe faction links have been completely removed from the city.\n\nPatch History\nReleased prior to Patch list #1\nPatch list #110 : 10/09/19\nChanged full map mode to become enabled when attempting to use the territory tools on the city map.\nPatch list #85 : 12/03/19\nChanged \"City\" top-right link / icon for all pages featured in the City.\n\nCity\nWest Side Education · Your Gym · Travel agency\nNorth Side Auction House · Church · Item Market · Points Building · Points Market\nRed-Light Casino · Dump · Loan Shark · Missions · Raceway\nResidential Your Property\nCity Center Chronicle Archives · City Hall · Community Center · Hospital · Jail · Museum · Player Committee · Staff · Visitor Center\nFinancial Bank · Donator House · Messaging Inc · Stock Market\nEast Side Big Al's Gun Shop · Bits 'n' Bobs · Cyber Force · Docks · Estate Agents · Jewelry Store · Nikeh Sports · Pawn Shop · Pharmacy · Post Office · Print Store · Recycling Center · Super Store · Sweet Shop · TC Clothing · Token Shop"

If you quit a job then choose to re-apply at a later date you will still have to retake the interview.\nThere is an honor bar for offending all interviewers, but it is not recommended for player's looking for a place in Starter Jobs, because it disallows you to re-apply for around 3 days.\nSpecials marked as Passive are in effect even if you are not working in that job anymore.\nArmy\nPosition Required Stats Stats Gained Pay Job Points Points for Promotion Job Special\nMan Int End Man Int End\nPrivate 2 2 2 3 1 2 $125 1 5 Strength boost for army points\nCorporal 50 15 20 5 2 3 $150 2 10  \nSergeant 120 35 50 8 3 5 $180 3 15 Steal weapon for 10 army points\nMaster Sergeant 325 60 115 12 4 7 $220 4 20  \nWarrant Officer 700 160 300 17 7 10 $225 5 25  \nLieutenant 1300 360 595 20 9 11 $325 6 30 Defence boost for army points\nMajor 2550 490 900 24 10 13 $550 7 35  \nColonel 4150 600 1100 28 12 15 $755 8 40\nBrigadier 7500 1350 2530 33 18 15 $1000 9 45  \nGeneral 10000 2000 4000 40 25 20 $2500 10   Spy a player's battle stats for 10 army points and $5,000\nGrocer\nPosition Required Stats Stats Gained Pay Job Points Points for Promotion Job Special\nMan Int End Man Int End\nBag Boy 2 2 2 2 1 3 $150 1 5 Steal cash for 1 Grocer point\nPrice Labeller 30 15 50 3 2 5 $175 2 10 Steal a bag of Candy for 2 Grocer points\nCashier 50 35 120 5 3 8 $210 3 15 Steal a bottle of Alcohol for 5 Grocer points\nFood Delivery 120 60 225 10 5 15 $250 4 20  \nManager 250 200 500 15 10 20 $300 5   Steal an Energy Drink for 25 Grocer points\n\nNote: Stealing Energy Drink includes all available energy drinks\nCasino\nPosition Required Stats Stats Gained Pay Job Points Points for Promotion Job Special\nMan Int End Man Int End\nDealer 2 2 2 1 2 3 $250 1 5 + Money for 1 Casino point\nGaming Consultant 35 50 120 2 3 5 $350 2 10 +25 Casino Tokens for 1 Casino point\nMarketing Manager 60 115 325 4 7 12 $500 3 15  \nRevenue Manager 360 595 1300 9 11 20 $1000 4 20 + Money for 1 Casino point\nCasino Manager 490 900 2550 10 13 24 $1750 5 25  \nCasino President 755 1100 4150 12 15 28 $3500 6   + Money for 10 Casino points and $100,000 [1]\n↑ Payout ranges from approximately $120,000 to $160,000 (therefore profit is approximately $20,000 to $60,000)\nMedical\nPosition Required Stats Stats Gained Pay Job Points Points for Promotion Job Special\nMan Int End Man Int End\nMedical Student 0 300 0 4 12 7 $400 1 5\nHouseman 100 600 150 7 17 10 $600 2 10 Steal small first aid kit for 2 Medical points\nSenior Houseman 175 1000 275 9 20 11 $950 3 15 Steal first aid kit for 4 Medical points\nGP 300 1500 500 10 24 13 $1500 4 20 Steal morphine for 7 Medical points.\nConsultant 600 2500 1000 12 28 15 $3000 5 25  \nSurgeon 1300 5000 2000 18 33 15 $5,000 6 30  \nBrain Surgeon 2600 10000 4000 20 40 25 $7,000 7   Revive someone for 75 energy (Passive)\nEducation\nPosition Required Stats Stats Gained Pay Job Points Points for Promotion Job Special\nMan Int End Man Int End\nRecess Supervisor 0 500 0 8 10 9 $300 1 5 +100 Manual per 10 Education Points\nSubstitute Teacher 300 750 500 13 15 14 $400 2 10  \nElementary Teacher 600 1000 700 15 20 17 $600 3 15 +100 Endurance per 10 Education Points\nSecondary Teacher 1000 1300 1000 20 25 20 $850 4 20  \nProfessor 1500 2000 1500 25 30 25 $1000 5 25 +100 Intel per 10 Education Points\nVice Principal 1500 3000 1500 30 35 30 $1750 6 30  \nPrincipal 1500 5000 1500 30 40 30 $3250 7   Gain 10% passive decrease in completion time for all future education courses (Passive)\nLaw\nPosition Required Stats Stats Gained Pay Job Points Points for Promotion Job Special\nMan Int End Man Int End\nLaw Student 0 0 1500 15 15 20 $150 1 5 Gain 3 nerve for 5 law points.\nParalegal 1750 2500 5000 17 20 23 $600 2 10 Gain money for 100 law points.\nProbate Lawyer 2500 5000 7500 19 23 30 $750 3 15  \nTrial Lawyer 3500 6500 7750 25 27 35 $1500 4 20 Get someone out of jail for 15 law points\nCircuit Court Judge 4000 7250 10000 27 30 38 $2500 5 25  \nFederal Judge 6000 9000 15000 30 33 45 $5000 6   +5% in crime exp & skill gain (Passive)\nNotes\nIrritating all job interviewers grants The Affronted Honor Bar\nHistorical Notes\nOld Medical Student Special: +1 Life per 1000 Medical Points\n\nPatch History\nReleased prior to Patch list #1\nPatch list #259 : 04/10/22\nChanged job leaving notification panels to have a red confirmation and green success, like related areas\nPatch list #250 : 02/08/22\nRebuilt the Army's Strength & Defense job specials to use a similar (but half as powerful) variant of the [mechanism of gym gain cap removal beyond 50m]\nPatch list #198 : 29/06/21\nAdded system to fire people from starter jobs after 400 days of inactivity\n\nBack to Top"

To unlock the new \"standard\" gyms all you have to do is train and pay the fee to open the new gym. You’ll slowly gain gym EXP which will allow you to access new and better gyms. The next gym will be available for you once you have the required gym EXP to join. To join, click the [Activate] button next to the gyms name and click the Buy Membership button.\nAll gyms have unique action text for each stat, for example: \"You managed to complete 1 bicep curl using the 23kg dumbbells\". You’ll see this action text constantly improve as you increase your stats.\nNext to each stat, there are 10 individual bars (multipliers). How much you gain from each gym is indicated by how many bars are highlighted. For example, in the Global Gym each stat has 4 bars highlighted while Premier Fitness only has 2 bars highlighted for each stat.\nAll gyms have a unique set of multipliers, some will provide more stats than others, some will not allow you to train certain stats at all. You can see the Gym Overview before you purchase a membership to see roughly what stats you’ll be getting.\nNote for new players: The Defense gains in Crim's (the gym found in jail) are better than the Defense gains in any of the lightweight gyms. If you are a new player and find yourself in jail, consider training Defense in Crim's Gym. Once you reach the middleweight gym Pioneer Fitness there is no longer an advantage to using the jail gym.\n\nStandard Gyms Overview\nNote: In the API, the \"Gains\" are stored as a factor of 10 higher.

The amount of happy loss is 40-60% of the energy used per train. The happy loss wouldn't change with the source of the energy you used for training (natural/drugs/energy drinks/refills).\n*Ex: (5 x 10 E trains) You used 50 energy and 27 happiness training your defense 5 times in Force Training increasing it by xxxxx to xxxxxxx\nHistorical Notes\nWhen the cap on happiness was raised to 99,999 the formula changed entirely, this was the most accurate formula in the old system.\nThe most accurate formula at the moment, according to Darkkk's Guide is:\n*((Gym Dots * 4) * ((0.00019106 * Stat) + (0.00226263 * Happy) + 0.55)) * (1 + Steadfast + Education Bonus) / 150 * Energy Used\n**with the 0.006% - 0.169% margin of error.**\n\nGym Training Stat Cap Removal\nOn 02/08/22 Chedburn announced the Stat cap removal:\nAfter many months of careful consideration, we have decided to remove the gym 'stat cap', a limit that halts the growth of gym gains after reaching 50,000,000 in a stat. Beyond this point, gym gains will now continue to increase at a steadily decreasing rate, allowing for controlled, exponential growth more comparable with the gains received from stat enhancers.\nEveryone should now notice their gym gains increasing slightly with every training session, however, this change only makes a meaningful difference to those who have stats in the multiple billions. Heavy stat enhancer usage still provides significant gains far quicker than anything else can when stats are in the billions, but gym training now has some relevance again for those who had previously abandoned it.\nI have provided some rough examples to express the scale of change that's happening. Instead of stat growth stagnating before 5b stats, some level of limited growth continues. We define heavy training as using 1500e every day with the happiness of a fully upgraded PI in George's gym, but without Steadfast.\nHeavily training a 50m stat will yield 211.75% monthly growth, the same as before.\nHeavily training a 100m stat will now yield 108.05% monthly growth instead of 103.35%.\nHeavily training a 1b stat will now yield 12.87% monthly growth instead of 10.33%.\nHeavily training a 5b stat will now yield 4.47% monthly growth instead of 2.07%.\nHeavily training a 10b stat will now yield 3.37% monthly growth instead of 1.03%.\nHeavily training a 50b stat will now yield 2.40% monthly growth instead of 0.21%.\nHeavily training a 100b stat will now yield 2.24% monthly growth instead of 0.10%.\nHeavily training a 500b stat will now yield 2.03% monthly growth instead of 0.02%.\nHeavily training a 1t stat will now yield 1.97% monthly growth instead of 0.01%.\nThere are several strong reasons for making this change...\nReducing the dependency on having to afford stat enhancers for end-game stat building.\nMore variation of player stats at the end-game for those who don't have access to stat enhancers.\nThe satisfaction of continued growth of gains per train, even if the difference isn't significantly meaningful to most.\nFor further reading please also see the related newspaper article\n\nPatch History\nReleased prior to Patch list #1\nPatch list #276 : 14/02/23\nAdded gym logo button animations upon hover / tap\nStat cap removal : 02/08/22\nAfter many months of careful consideration, we have decided to remove the gym 'stat cap', a limit that halts the growth of gym gains after reaching 50,000,000 in a stat.

        "content": "A Property is a player-owned entity that the player can live in. All players have a default Shack that they start with (this can't be sold). The primary purpose of having a property is to maximise one's max Happy. Upgrading one's property usually results in increasing one's max Happy: with a higher Happy value, the more Battle Stats one will gain.\nThe three most expensive properties also provide other benefits in addition to increased Happy.\nContents\n1 Lease\n2 Owning\n3 Moving\n4 Upkeep\n5 Properties\n5.1 Standard Houses\n5.2 Fully Upgraded Houses (Without staff)\n5.3 Fully Upgraded Houses (With staff)\n6 House Upgrades\n6.1 Facilities and Modification\n6.2 Staff\n7 Additional properties' benefits\n8 Unique Properties\n9 Patch History\nLease\nIf the player doesn't have enough buying power to purchase a type of Property, they can lease the type of property from other players. The landlord has full control over leasing market price, leasing length, and upgrades before the tenant \"accepts\" the terms. Once the lease is in effect, neither party can alter the terms (price, length including cancelling the lease, and upgrades).\nLeasing price is all paid upfront, no daily fees are paid to the landlord. However, tenants can still choose to hire staff, for which fees still apply, and which will rack up until the end of the lease. If there is an outstanding upkeep on the property at the end of the lease, the debt is transferred over to Duke [4] to manage.\nIn rented properties, the vault upgrade cannot be accessed.\nFrom 10/06/21, Property landlords can offer their tenants an extension to their lease before the end of their contract.\nAs long as the rental duration doesn't exceed a maximum of 100 days, contracts can be extended and renewed at any point during the occupancy.\nAll property leases, when expiring, will end at 03:30 a.m Torn-Time, regardless of the time that the renter started the lease of the property.\nOwning\nThere are various discounts that can reduce the price of purchasing/upgrading properties:\nELT Stock Benefit - 10% discount to all home upgrade costs\n10* Property Broker - 10% discount to all home upgrade costs\nLAW2910\n- 5% discount to purchasing properties from the Estate Agents.\nOwners have the ability to share their vault with their spouse. This is disabled by default. By enabling it, your spouse will be able to deposit and withdraw from the same pool of money. There's also a log below the panel, displaying transactions to and from the vault.[1]\nYou can also move into a different property without removing the funds from your old property's vault. The funds will remain inside that property until you move back in.\nProperties that are owned may be sold by placing the property into the Selling Market, or by selling directly to the Estate Agents. (Requires the property to be vacant)\nWhen selling the property back to the estate agents, then remaining unpaid upkeep and staff fees are deducted from sale value.\nMoving\nMove in: Once you own or rent a property, you will get an option to move in. You can only use the facilities of the property after moving in. Your spouse can also move in to any property owned/rented by you and not under lease. They can't hire staff. The vault can only be used with your permission, which you can revoke at any point of time.\nMove Out: You can only change in to another property to leave the present property. You can not move in to another property without first firing all the hired staff and clearing the balance upkeep. You need not kick your spouse to move out. They can continue staying in the property, but they can not hire any staff.\nIf you are living in your spouse's property you can move in and out freely.\nUpkeep\nWhether you own or lease the property, there are daily upkeep and staff fees which can be be paid by you and/or your spouse.\nIf a property's fees build up too much then after a certain threshold of unpaid fees, the maximum happiness that the property provides will gradually decrease - all the way to 0 over a long period of time. The threshold for happiness reduction is equal to 10% of the property's original value without upgrades, and happiness reduction can be calculated using the following formula:\nif (upkeep >= 0.1 * property_cost): \n   happy_reduction = (upkeep - 0.1 * property_cost) / property_cost * 2.5\nelse:\n   happy_reduction = 0\nIf either spouse works in a 7* Lingerie Store, the upkeep and staff costs for the property they reside in are waived. (If you had previously unpaid fees, then your debt is not cancelled when joining a company, your fees simply will not increase.)\nProperties\nStandard Houses\nInformation on Houses bought from the City (No upgrades/staff)\nStandard Properties\nName Cost at Estate Agency Base Happy Daily Upkeep $ per Happy Value at Estate Agency\nShack $0 100 $0 $0 $0\nTrailer $5,000 110 $10 $45 $3,750\nApartment $25,000 125 $25 $200 $18,750\nSemi-Detached House $75,000 150 $70 $500 $56,250\nDetached House $300,000 200 $150 $1,500 $225,000\nBeach House $500,000 300 $200 $1,666 $375,000\nChalet $750,000 350 $300 $2,142 $562,500\nVilla $1,250,000 400 $350 $3,125 $937,500\nPenthouse $2,000,000 450 $450 $4,444 $1,500,000\nMansion $3,000,000 500 $500 $6,000 $2,250,000\nRanch $15,000,000 600 $1,000 $25,000 $11,250,000\nPalace $65,000,000 1,000 $3,000 $65,000 $48,750,000\nCastle $200,000,000 1,500 $10,000 $133,333 $150,000,000\nPrivate Island $500,000,000 2,000 $100,000 $250,000 $375,000,000\nFully Upgraded Houses (Without staff)\nFully Upgraded Properties (without Staff)\nName Cost at Estate Agency Base Happy Daily Upkeep $ per Happy\nShack $0 100 $0 $0\nTrailer $7,500 165 $10 $46\nApartment $37,500 188 $25 $200\nSemi-Detached House $141,500 275 $70 $515\nDetached House $979,000 500 $150 $1,958\nBeach House $1,279,000 650 $200 $1,968\nChalet $1,654,000 725 $300 $2,282\nVilla $2,404,000 800 $350 $3,005\nPenthouse $3,538,000 925 $450 $3,825\nMansion $5,038,000 1,000 $500 $5,039\nRanch $23,288,000 1,200 $1,000 $19,408\nPalace $196,038,000 1,875 $3,000 $105,968\nCastle $415,788,000 2,725 $10,000 $152,586\nPrivate Island $1,952,788,000 4,225 $100,000 $462,222\nFully Upgraded Houses (With staff)\nInformation on Houses bought from the City then Fully Upgraded (Includes staff).\nFully Upgraded Properties (with Staff)\nName Cost at Estate Agency Base Happy Daily Upkeep $ per Happy\nShack $0 100 $0 $0\nTrailer $7,500 165 $10 $46\nApartment $37,500 188 $25 $200\nSemi-Detached House $141,500 275 $70 $515\nDetached House $979,000 500 $150 $1,958\nBeach House $1,279,000 650 $200 $1,968\nChalet $1,654,000 725 $300 $2,282\nVilla $2,404,000 800 $350 $3,005\nPenthouse $3,538,000 1,150 $47,950 $3,118\nMansion $5,038,000 1,725 $198,000 $3,035\nRanch $23,288,000 1,925 $198,500 $12,201\nPalace $313,038,000 2,550 $200,500 $125,295\nCastle $532,788,000 3,475 $232,500 $153,387\nPrivate Island (*) $940,788,000 4,500 $352,500 $209,142\nPrivate Island $1,835,788,000 5,000 $352,500 $367,228\nPrivate Island (**) $1,952,788,000 5,025 $352,500 $388,684\n(*) Private Islands with 4500 happy are most common, and this was previously a fully upgraded property before Yachts were introduced.\n(**) This is a fully upgraded PI, both a yacht and the XL vault.

These properties sold for values between 12 and 23 billion dollars each in the original auctions, the only way to buy one nowadays is to purchase from a player who previously owned it. The most recent purchase was in May 2020 where the St Paul's Abbey was sold for 70 billion dollars, previous notable sales include the Royal Penthouse in 2016 for a 75 billion dollar value.\nInformation on houses: current happiness at maximum staffing and upgrades.\n\nUnique Properties\nName Happy Daily Upkeep Current Owner\nQueen Eleanor 7975 $250,000 David [132845]\nDrakkar Sea Fort 7725 $250,000 bogie [148747]\nEagle Island 7275 $250,000 BigNemesis [74296]\nRoyal Penthouse 7225 $250,000 beaker [371096]\nCerium Temple 7225 $250,000 xxx_alone_xxx [1306506]\nTrekant Tower 7225 $250,000 LeukyBear [83808]\nSt. Pauls Abbey 7225 $250,000 pokey477 [1271316]\nIron Fist Hill 7150 $250,000 Healen [78092]\nPresidential Bunker 6775 $250,000 deft [979003]\nMaidengrave 6775 $250,000 rudias [391053]\nUSS Bloodbath 6325 $250,000 diON [432049]\nSilo X17 6025 $250,000 Tezwar [1034523]\nAll of them have the normal house staff except some don't have airstrips, so not all have pilots.

Some Education courses require you to complete a certain prerequisite course before enrolling.\nStarting an education course will cost a player some money. If a player owns the IST Benefit Block, their education fees will be waived.\nWhile enrolled in an education course, a player can be kicked out of the course for drug usage. If this happens, a player will need start the course again from the very beginning.\nAdvantages of Education\nEarn Working Stats\nBoost gains in the Gym\nEarn passive buffs to Battle Stats\nUnlock Hacking Crimes, and Driving-related Crimes Transport Drugs and Arson\nBoost your crime success rate\nEarn 16 awards (Honors + Merits), 12 for completing a degree and 4 for completing a certain number of classes\nReduce the cost of Bails, Property upgrades and Company advertising\nIncrease Bust success rate and gain the ability to Bust yourself out of jail\nUnlock kick attack when in a battle\nIncrease the effectiveness of Weapons and temporary weapons (known as Steroids) found in the Pharmacy\nGain the ability to earn weapon experience for increased damage and accuracy in specific weapons used\nUnlock new locations on the map: the Museum and the Sports Shop\nIncrease Ammunition effectiveness\nIncrease Business Efficiency\nGain the ability to code Viruses\nGain the ability to send anonymous E-mails\nGain the ability to find Artifacts\nGain the ability to exchange Museum items (plushies, flowers, and artifacts) for Points\nGain the ability to draw blood and use Blood Bags\nBoost Awareness by a large amount\nHow to shorten Education time\nCurrently, there are six ways to shorten Education time:\nThrough the 1* Fitness Center special \"Healthy Mind\". Each job point used will reduce education time by 30 minutes.\nThrough the 7* Hair Salon special \"Cutting corners\". Each job point used will reduce education time by 30 minutes.\nUsing \"Book of Carols\" lowers current education time by 6 hours. This item spawns in Christmas Town.\nSpending Merits on decreasing education time. The merit upgrade removes 2% of the education time per upgrade, up to a maximum of 20% shorter education time with 10 upgrades.\nPromoting to the top rank of the starter job Education (Principal) you will gain a passive 10% decrease in education time. You will keep this passive even if you leave the starter job.\nHaving a West Side University (WSU) Stock Block of 1,000,000 shares will reduce education time by 10%.\nUsing job points in Fitness Center or Hair Salon will reduce your current education time by 30 minutes per. Book of Carols will reduce your current education time by 6 hours. Promoting to Principal, investing Merits in 'Education Length', or acquiring the WSU benefit block will reduce the length of any subsequent courses — having no effect on a course that has already been started.\nEducation reductions are calculated additively (I.e full education merits, WSU, and principal perk would be a 40% reduction)\nHistorical Notes\nPreviously percentage reductions to education time were calculated separately (I.e full education merits, WSU, and principal perk would not be a 40% reduction, but would work out to be 35%.) If you would like to calculate how long your education will last you can use the following formula:\n(1-x)*(1-y)*(1-z)*l\nx = 0.10 from WSU\ny = 0.20 from merits\nz = 0.10 from job\nl = Education length\nThis was changed in April 2024\nPatch History\nReleased prior to Patch list #1\nPatch list #368 : 07/01/2025\nFixed ability to program Firewalk Virus not being mentioned in the Algorithms & Advanced Programming course\nPatch list #334 : 16/04/24\nChanged Education course time reduction bonuses to be additive instead of multiplicative\nPatch list #259 : 04/10/22\nChanged method of leaving education courses to be more consistent with leaving factions, companies, and jobs\nPatch list #196 : 15/06/21\nFixed Sports Medicine education course not providing 10% to temporary booster passive stat increases\nPatch list #188 : 13/04/21\nRenamed Recoil Pad's \"control\" and Education's \"ammo management\" bonuses to \"ammo conservation\".\nPatch list #185 : 23/03/21\nChanged \"Master of Self Defense\" course name to \"Bachelor of Self Defense\".\nPatch list #179 : 09/02/21\nChanged 'Anatomy' education course from +5% (+3.5% actual) to +3%.\nPatch list #174 : 29/12/20\nAdded new modifier Addiction Mitigation which reduces all effects of addiction.\nPatch list #172 : 15/12/20\nAdded an event which is received when an education course is completed (only educations after today).\nPatch list #132 : 10/03/20\nChanged 'rate of fire' educations / weapon mod to be additive and use stochastic rounding.\nReduced Bachelor of Mathematics education to provide 20% ammo management instead of 30%.\nPatch list #103 : 23/07/19\nChanged Self Defence bachelor bonus to affect the final damage of fists instead of internal damage modifier.\n\nCity\nWest Side Education · Your Gym · Travel agency\nNorth Side Auction House · Church · Item Market · Points Building · Points Market\nRed-Light Casino · Dump · Loan Shark · Missions · Raceway\nResidential Your Property\nCity Center Chronicle Archives · City Hall · Community Center · Hospital · Jail · Museum · Player Committee · Staff · Visitor Center\nFinancial Bank · Donator House · Messaging Inc · Stock Market\nEast Side Big Al's Gun Shop · Bits 'n' Bobs · Cyber Force · Docks · Estate Agents · Jewelry Store · Nikeh Sports · Pawn Shop · Pharmacy · Post Office · Print Store · Recycling Center · Super Store · Sweet Shop · TC Clothing · Token Shop"

Successful crimes provide Crime Experience (CE) and Crime Skill (CS), introduced with Crimes 2.0.\nCE is a hidden metric that determines your natural nerve bar (NNB) and influences success rates in Organised Crimes (OCs). It is not specifically tied to a particular crime or OC. Unlike with Crime there is no cap to NNBs, however each increment of 5 is harder to achieve.\nCS is a metric measured in levels, individually for each crime, displayed with a progress bar on each crime page.\nEach crime has a number of subcrimes. By default at level 1 in any given crime, some subcrimes will be available and some subcrimes will be locked. Depending on the subcrime you may be able to unlock it in different ways:\nBy obtaining a special item.\nBy leveling up in the crime.\nFor example, in the \"Search for Cash\" crime, immediately available are the Trash, Subway and Junkyard. The Beach and Cemetery are unlocked by obtaining the Metal Detector and Cemetery Key respectively, and the Fountain is unlocked by reaching level 75 in Search for Cash. It is unknown if Battle Stats or Work Stats affect success rates in the Crimes 2.0 system. [4]\nCrime Categories\nCommitting up to 10,000 crimes in each category will earn you 15 medals per category. 12 crimes are currently divided into six categories.\nTheft: Search For Cash, Shoplifting, Pickpocketing and Burglary\nCounterfeiting: Bootlegging and Forgery\nVandalism: Graffiti\nFraud: Card Skimming, Hustling and Scamming\nIllicit Services: Disposal\nCybercrime: Cracking\nExtortion: no crimes released yet\nIllegal production: no crimes released yet\nOutcomes\nThere are three basic results from doing any crime:\nSuccess: this will provide cash, items or a mix, in addition to some amount of CE and CS.\nFail: these are orange and will provide no reward, but also no loss of CE or CS.\nCritical Fail: these are red and will result in a significant loss of CE and CS (you may notice you drop down an entire level) as well as the possibility of one of the following:\nJail time\nLoss of Life\nHospital time\nItem or money loss\nPenalties specific to the crime, such as losing card details in Card Skimming\nEach outcome also temporarily affects your progression from future crimes - discussed below.\nSuccess rates for each subcrime depend on unique time-dependent factors; for example, a player will have a much higher chance of success doing \"Search the Cemetery\" while the groundskeeper is not on duty. These subcrime success rates can be seen in a tooltip:\nEach Search for Cash crime provides money and/or items as rewards, however it is currently unknown whether this will be the case for every further crime once the system is fully released.\nUnique Outcomes\nCrimes now feature some outcomes that a player can obtain a single time, i.e. \"uniquely\". Unique outcomes may give slightly more valuable rewards, or even special items required by subsequent subcrimes (e.g. finding the Metal Detector is a unique outcome from Search the Junkyard).\nWhen available, unique outcomes are indicated by a star on the subcrime button:\nWhen a unique outcome is triggered, this star will turn gold for a few seconds, and there will be a small delay before you can attempt another crime.\nUnique outcomes are available only when certain conditions are met:\nSome unique outcomes are Crime Skill dependent - if you drop down a level due to a critical fail, you may lose access to a unique outcome.\nSome unique outcomes may be time-dependent based on the same mechanics that govern success rates. For example in the Search the Beach subcrime, there is a unique outcome that is only available at high-tide.\nCrime Chains and Progression\nCrime Progression is a new perk for Crimes 2.0 that increases how much CE and CS you gain with each crime. All preexisting perks with respect to CE have been merged into crime progression, and they are combined additively to provide a total percentage bonus to your CE and CS gains:\n+10% from Criminality Faction upgrades\n+10% from Crime Progression Merit upgrades\n+10% from Education\n+5% from the relevant Crime Enhancer\n+5% from completing the Law starter job\n(up to) +15% from Company specials.\nNote: The Criminality special \"Crimes\" providing a passive bonus to your CE, which can be upgraded from 1 to 25, is still in effect for players that have not yet migrated. On your personal perks page you will see the correct effect description, however until a full rollout of Crimes 2.0 is complete, the Criminality page will still display the old bonus. For Crimes 2.0 players, every bonus past \"Crimes X\" has no effect.\nA Crime Chain is something that builds up slowly as you have more crime successes. Higher chains result in increased CE and CS gains from subsequent successful crimes (all crimes, no matter which crime was used to build the chain).\nA Failure will halve your current crime chain bonus.\nA Critical Failure will zero your current crime chain bonus.\nA Critical Failure will also demoralize you when performing crimes in the future, resulting in reduced CE and CS gains. This effect will wear off gradually with subsequent successful offenses in any crimes.\nCrimes\nSearch For Cash\nRead the main article: Search For Cash for full details on each subcrime.\nSearch for cash is the first type of crime released for Crimes 2.0.

Players will only gain progress towards reputation stars (and the occasional spray can) when first attempting the crime, but cash payouts and unique results are given as a player gets a higher reputation.\nA player's reputation in an area is independent from reputation in other areas. Reputation will decrease slowly over time as authorities cover a player's graffiti.\nEnhancer: Paint Mask\nGraffiti has 41 unique outcomes in total.\nShoplifting\nRead the main article: Shoplifting for full details on each subcrime.\nShoplifting is the fourth crime released for Crimes 2.0.

Notoriety gains will depend on the types of successes or failures.\nEach shop features one or two security statuses that may occasionally become disabled. Security statutes being on/off will affect possible outcomes and notoriety gains. It is intended that a player can still succeed with a reasonable success rate, even with high notoriety.\nEnhancer: Mountain Bike\nShoplifting has 55 unique outcomes in total.\nNote: It is possible to have a critical fail when shoplifting in which a player will lose their mountain bike.\nPickpocketing\nRead the main article: Pickpocketing for full details on each subcrime.\nPickpocketing is the fifth crime released for Crimes 2.0.

At a time of your choosing, you may then recover your skimmer from the ATM to collect and sell the details contained within. Both items are returned upon the successful recovery of the Skimmer.\nThe longer you leave Card Skimmer and Spy Camera, the chance increases that a player will lose either or both item.\nA player can only have a maximum of 20 concurrent active skimmers.\nEnhancer: Duct Tape\nCard Skimming has 0 unique outcome at the time of the release.\nBurglary\nRead the main article: Burglary for full details on each subcrime.\nBurglary is the seventh crime released for Crimes 2.0.

It is a Fraud crime.\nThis crime involves you first gather an audience, demonstrate the confidence trick to them, then persuade them to place bets. From here, you can then intentionally lose money to further capture their attention, thus increasing the chance and size of their bets, before you start cashing in on them. When you start winning, the audience members will start getting suspicious, which may prevent them from betting further, or even leaving altogether.\nEnhancer: Megaphone\nHustling has 0 unique outcome at the time of the release.\n\nDisposal\nRead the main article: Disposal for full details on each subcrime.\nDisposal is the ninth crime released for Crimes 2.0.

Additional targets with increasingly advanced passwords and levels of encryption will become available as skill level increases.\nPlayers can initially only use their Computer or Laptop. At level 25, the first of three rig chassis becomes available. Chassis can be equipped with CPU and cooling components to enhance a rig's MIPS. This increases its brute-forcing strength, allowing more characters to be revealed each cycle.\nEnhancer: Office Chair\nCracking has no unique outcomes.\nAn honor bar is available upon achieving level 100 in Cracking.

These can be found here. Alternatively please comment here!\nContents\n1 Introduction\n1.1 Standing\n1.2 Difficulty\n1.3 Mission credits\n2 Details\n2.1 George\n2.2 Anonymous\n2.3 Duke\n2.3.1 Contracts\n2.4 Amanda\n2.5 Other Agents\n3 Honors\n4 Patch History\nIntroduction\nStanding\nAs you successfully complete contracts for Duke or any other agent, you will gain standing. You can lose standing by failing or declining contracts. By successfully completing many contracts, the difficulty level, rewards and amount of contracts available will begin to rise.\nIf you decline a contract you will lose less standing in comparison to when you fail a mission. So don't just accept your contracts willy nilly!\nMissions can be left completed, but rewards unclaimed, indefinitely. Simply click \"complete\" to officially end the mission and receive mission credits and any additional rewards.\nContract with an asterisk (*) beside the name indicates a new contract that you have not receive before\nDifficulty\nUpon first meeting a contract giver/mission agent, everyone will start on Easy difficulty. As an example with Duke, the targets and challenges you face will be very simple and the rewards will be low - this will change dramatically as difficulty increases. In contrast, some Expert contracts may be impossible to complete without assistance from others, but they'll provide on average 16x higher money rewards and 5x mission credit rewards.\nYou can increase the difficulty of contracts he provides by increasing your standing with him. There are 5 levels of difficulty: Easy, Medium, Hard, Very hard and Expert. Each tier dramatically increases the money and mission credit reward and will unlock more contracts that were previously unavailable.\nIt is possible to still receiving contracts in lower difficulty than your current standing; i.e., if you have Expert level unlocked it is still possible to receive Medium difficulty contracts.\nBefore you can unlock a new difficulty level, Duke will provide a special contract that you must complete. By completing these special contracts, future contracts will have a chance to spawn at a higher difficulty. Some specific contracts have set difficulty levels, so you may sometimes receive lower difficulty contracts than you're expecting.\nMission credits\nThe mission credits panel (seen at the bottom of the Missions page) is where you can spend your mission credits. Mission credits are a new currency given when missions and contracts are completed. They can also be obtained by trading job points in a 10 star Private Security Firm.\nSix random rewards will spawn here at a time. When one is purchased, it will be replaced by another one. Every unpurchased reward will be replaced by a new one every 7 days.\nThe rewards may appear expensive at first due to the amount of mission credits received at lower difficulties. The team behind Torn also wants the special rewards to actually be special - by keeping their prices high.\nRewards to look out for are books, attachments and Special ammunition.\nDetails\nGeorge\nGeorge gives new players introductory missions to get them going in the game, more information about these missions can be found Here.\nAnonymous\nAnonymous is a mission agent, who will introduce you to all others. Currently, he only has one mission, which is an introductory mission for Duke, which requires you to complete 10 contracts. Upon completion, you will gain an honor bar, and 100 mission credits.\nAnonymous is unlocked once reaching level 5.\nDuke\nDuke - the Loan Shark - is a mission agent, who will ask you to complete contracts in return for Mission credits.\nContracts\nContracts are like mini-missions. You'll be asked to complete fairly simple randomly generated tasks that utilize already existing game mechanics. Duke currently provides 67 separate contracts of which most are repeatable. We'll also constantly be adding new ones based on feedback and suggestions.\nEvery agent we add will have a different theme. Duke's contracts are almost entirely focused around attacking (a sensible starting point), so most of the tasks will be somewhat similar--although receiving the same contract with the same task and target more than once is very rare.\nDuke will provide one contract per day, at midnight. You can have up to three available or in-progress contracts at a time (this could be increased to five when working in a Logistics Management company ranked three stars or higher).\nAmanda\nProfessor Amanda Ravenscroft, a mission giver that has yet to be released.\nOther Agents\nAs of 07/03/2024, there is no information regarding the release of additional agents beyond Duke and Amanda.\nHonors\nThere are three honor bars that can be achieved by completing missions.\n- Complete the mission Introduction: Duke\n- Earn 10,000 mission credits\n- Complete 1,000 contracts\nPatch

Alternatively please comment here!\nContents\n1 In Jail\n2 Busting\n3 Self bust\n4 Bail\n5 Helpful things\n6 Related Awards\n7 Side notes\n8 See Also\n9 Patch History\nIn Jail\nCity Jail is where you go when you get caught by violating city law and enter into conflict with police.\nThe following actions will send you to Jail:\nFailing a Crime (getting a red result) this will result in jail time and a loss of Crime Experience.\nFailing a Bust\nFailing an Organised Crime (getting a jail result) this will result in jail time and a smaller loss of Crime Experience.\nGetting arrested by another player.\nThere is a massive difference in jail time, it can range from ten minutes to over several hours.\nWhilst in the City Jail you have restricted access to the game until you escape or are busted out.\nYou can do your gym training at Crims. You cannot train dexterity, but you can train the other three stats. Note that the strength and speed gains are better at Crims than the first four lightweight gyms, and the defense gains at Crims are better than ALL of the lightweight gyms and the first middleweight gym (Knuckle Heads).\nBusting\nBusting is an attempt to free an imprisoned person from the Jail by someone outside. The following things impact the chance to successfully bust a player from jail:\nPerks from faction (In the Criminality tree, bust success can be increased to up to 50%)\nPerks from Education (Law)\nPerks from job (Working at a Law Firm makes busting easier and also shows the bust success chance)\nYour total number of already completed busts (the more you've done the easier it is)\nLevel (Being a higher level increases the bust chance, and busting lower levels is easier)\nTime (Multiple busts in quick succession lower success rates)\nEvery bust attempt costs 5 nerve, which can reduced by up to 3 with the relevant faction upgrades in the Criminality tree.\nThere are three possible outcomes to a busting attempt:\nSuccess: The jailed player receives the event \"[busting player] busted you out of jail.\"\nFailure: The jailed player remains in jail and the buster loses five nerve, but is not jailed. The jailed player will receive the event \"[busting player] failed to bust you out of jail.\"\nJailed: The busting player fails the bust and is also sent to jail. The jailed player receives the event \"[busting player] was caught trying to bust you out of jail.\" A failed bust will result in jail time of one to three hours.\nA player is more easily busted the lower their level and jail time is. The reason a player is in jail does not appear to be a significant factor in the difficulty of a bust[1].\nBusting is an especially difficult activity for new, low-level players. The education classes in Law can help with busting for new players.\nSelf bust\nAttempting a self bust will cost half of a player's max nerve bar (rounded up).\nCompleting the LAW2990 education reduces the self bail nerve requirement from one half to one third.\nFailure when self busting will add to a player's Jail time.\nBail\nIn addition to busting someone, there is also the option to buy someone out of jail costing an amount in dollars equal to (100 * remaining Jail time in minutes * inmate level).\nHowever this cost can be reduced by up to 57.25% through education and 50% through the Law Firm 1* Company Special.\nYou are able to buy yourself out of prison by the completion of Common law\nHelpful things\nYou can improve your break out ability by:\nParticipating in law education courses, which can grant perks such as:\nreduced chance of being caught when trying to escape from Jail\nreduced amount of Nerve required to escape from Jail.\nthe ability to buy yourself out of Jail.\ngive a total 15% bonus to your skill in Busting and the same discount when buying people out of Jail.\nBachelor of Law makes busting 50% easier and buying out 50% cheaper.\nJoining a 5* or better law firm. The 5* special 'Closing Argument' allows for a longer bust chain, and the 10* special 'Educated Decisions' allows you to see the success chance of your busts.\nUsing a Lawyer Business Card will instantly get you out of jail, though this item is consumed on use. It is available via LAG's stock benefit.\nPlayers in the Law job who have reached the position of Trial Lawyer can get a player out of jail in exchange for 15 job points.\nRelated Awards\nYou can receive 7 medals for successful busts and there are 5 honors available for Jail related activities;\nExpand\nJail related awards\nSide notes\nSelf busting used to give a free boost to your dexterity (0.1% of current stat). This was later changed to 0.05%, before being removed.\nSelf busting used to only be possible if your jail time was lower than 200 minutes. This was since removed because of a bug report.\nDefinitive information on busting and crime experience can be found in this announcement from May, 2014.\nIn the past, your dexterity contributed to your bust success chance, but this is no longer the case.\nSee Also\nFederal Jail\n\nPatch History\nReleased prior to Patch list #1\nPatch list #185 : 23/03/21\nChanged hospital time to override & replace jail time (can no longer be in both at once).\nChanged faction money & points depositing to not be possible while in hospital or jail.\nPatch list #171 : 08/12/20\nAdded link to 'Jail' after using alcohol.\nJail crime experience loss\nNow, upon going to jail, the maximum crime experience you can lose is a static value of around 20x what you would have gained upon success. If this loss is more than 1% of your total crime experience, then 1% will be removed instead.\nPatch list #164 : 20/10/20\nChanged crime exp loss upon jail to be far less significant.\nPatch list #152 : 28/07/20\nUpdated main backgrounds for regular / jail / hospital / abroad states.\nPatch list #131 : 03/03/20\nChanged attack log results to 'Interrupted' instead of 'Escaped' when target goes to hospital / jail during attack.\nPatch list #128 : 11/02/20\nAdded auto-leave when defeating a target and then being jailed (I.e. via organised crime).\nPatch list #61 : 18/09/18\nChanged stock market to allow access while in Hospital / Jail.\nPatch list #44 : 15/05/18\nDisabled blood withdrawal and some various boosters while in jail.\nPatch list #20 : 14/11/17\nChanged jail/hospital page access permissions while hosped/jailed at the same time.\n\nCity\nWest Side Education · Your Gym · Travel agency\nNorth Side Auction House · Church · Item Market · Points Building · Points Market\nRed-Light Casino · Dump · Loan Shark · Missions · Raceway\nResidential Your Property\nCity Center Chronicle Archives · City Hall · Community Center · Hospital · Jail · Museum · Player Committee · Staff · Visitor Center\nFinancial Bank · Donator House · Messaging Inc · Stock Market\nEast Side Big Al's Gun Shop · Bits 'n' Bobs · Cyber Force · Docks · Estate Agents · Jewelry Store · Nikeh Sports · Pawn Shop · Pharmacy · Post Office · Print Store · Recycling Center · Super Store · Sweet Shop · TC Clothing · Token Shop\n\n↑ Nosy, Advanced Jail Bust Guide (22/10/20)"

An alternative hospital icon is activated for when the early discharge is available to the player.[2]\nPlayers will have their health bar recovered to whatever it was before they were attacked by the outside hitter.[3]\nEarly Discharge will be immediately available at the start of Ranked Wars and Territory Wars for all incoming outside hits. [4]\nThe flowchart below shows how an outside hit is determined:\nElimination\nAn addendum has been placed on the definition of an \"Outside Hit\" regarding the Elimination competition that runs in September.

Some user names remain hidden to others, such as battle stats ranking, however, it does indicate where you stand in the whole game in comparison to the rest of the player base.\nYou can access the Hall Of Fame via the Sidebar.\nIn addition to the main Hall Of Fame listings, there are three specialized rankings that are not available on the main Hall Of Fame page.

        "title": "Faction",
        "url": "https://wiki.torn.com/wiki/Faction",
        "content": "A Faction is a group of players that play Torn together under the same name and banner, with a shared vision of the game. Factions are led by a Leader and an optional Co-leader; they allow for the sharing of resources (via the Armory) in addition to collective crime and warring efforts (via Organized Crime and Warfare).\nContents\n1 Starting A Faction\n1.1 Going Inactive (Faction Leader)\n1.2 Application Process\n2 Faction Warfare\n2.1 Respect\n2.1.1 Gaining Respect\n2.1.2 Losing Respect\n2.2 Chaining\n2.3 Faction Raiding\n2.3.1 Initiating a Raid\n2.3.2 Ceasing a Raid\n2.4 Faction Destruction\n2.5 Territories\n2.6 Ranked Warring\n2.7 Outsider vs. Insider Hits\n3 Organized Crime Panel\n4 Upgrades Panel\n4.1 Armory\n4.2 Chaining\n4.3 Capacity\n4.4 Territory\n4.5 Special Branches\n4.5.1 Toleration\n4.5.2 Steadfast\n4.5.3 Aggression\n4.5.4 Excursion\n4.5.5 Fortitude\n4.5.6 Voracity\n4.5.7 Criminality\n4.5.8 Suppression\n4.6 Challenges\n5 Controls Panel\n5.1 Give To User\n5.2 Faction Communication\n5.3 Pay Day\n5.4 Applications\n5.5 Members\n5.6 Positions\n5.6.1 Laboratory\n5.7 Deletion\n6 Historical Notes\n7 Patch History\n8 References\nStarting A Faction\nFactions are one of the most popular activities in Torn. Starting a new faction costs $1,000 x number of factions currently in the game, although a faction can be purchased for less in the faction buying and selling thread in the forums. A brand new faction will have 5,000 respect and will be based in a shed, giving a maximum member space of 5 members. This can further be upgraded in the Upgrades Panel. To start a new faction, visit the Factions Page while not in a faction.\nA faction's success may be measured by its total current respect and the upgrades that it has. To see the best factions in the game, go to the Hall of Fame in the newspapers.\nGoing Inactive (Faction Leader)\nIf a faction's leader goes inactive for more than 30 days, leadership will be automatically transferred to the Co-Leader. If the faction does not have a Co-Leader it will instead be transferred to the longest-serving member online in the last 24 hours.\nApplication Process\nPlayers can now have up to 10 pending Applications to factions at the same time. This means they're free to apply to several factions at the same time, greatly increasing the chances they'll get into one quickly. This solves the laborious process of applying to one, waiting for a response, and then applying to another.\nThe factions that show up in the player's list of available factions will be arranged to display those with the most similar members to the player first.[1]\nFaction leaders will no longer receive news or event spam with every received application. Instead, we've implemented a separate notification system which alerts those with permissions to pending applications.\nPlayers can edit their applications at any point after they have been sent out, or withdraw them, via the relevant Faction profile.\nOnce an application is accepted, all other related applications will be removed. So as a Faction leader, all of the applications you see will be from players who are available to join now.\nIf an application is declined or withdrawn, the player will not be able to reapply again for 72 hours. This restriction can be overridden by the Faction by toggling \"Allow applications\" off and on again.\nApplications expire after 72 hours if they have not been accepted or declined.\nFaction Warfare\nThese are features/play styles used by factions in order to gain respect, climb the Hall of Fame and get recognized by the Torn community.\nRespect\nRespect is what most factions will fight and die for. It can be used to show the Torn community how good your faction is, it can be used as bragging rights or it can be used for upgrading faction specials. Respect is gained and lost in many ways.\nGaining Respect\nAttacking and chaining against other players. Consecutive attacks in a short time period is known as chaining and is the most efficient way of gaining respect. See Gaining Respect\nYou can also accumulate respect, on a daily basis, by owning Territory blocks.\nMost factions will run Organized Crimes for the purpose of gaining respect, as well as some money in the process. They range in difficulty and number of members required.\nThe Television Station company special 'Propaganda' allows an employee to spend job points on gaining respect for the faction they are in. The faction news log will also have a record of this.\nLosing Respect\nWhen a faction is hit by a Dirty Bomb, it will lose a large amount of respect, and suffer from several other effects.\nWhen a member of a faction is attacked, the faction will lose 25% of the respect that the attacking player gained\nChaining\nView the main article on Chains\nChaining is a warring tool designed to supplement warring between two factions. Successive hits made on players outside of your faction will build a \"chain\", gradually earning more respect as the chain builds - and occasionally reaching \"bonus\" hits for large additional respect gains.\nChaining must be unlocked by spending respect. Once a faction has completed a chain of set length, it may unlock the next length chain. These purchases are non-refundable.\nThe first 10 hits in a chain must be made within 5 minutes. Beyond this, each successive hit must be made within 5 minutes or the chain will enter its cooldown state.\nAs the chain progresses, the respect earned will gradually increase - scaled logarithmically. At 13 possible points in a chain, designated \"bonus hits\", a hit will produce a large flat respect bonus.\nOnce a chain breaks, it will enter its cooldown state, which lasts 10 seconds for every hit made in the chain (e.g. 100 seconds for a 10-hit chain).\nChaining was completely redesigned in 2017 and unveiled in November as the first update in a much larger Warring 2.0 upgrade. Full details on the subject can be found on the Chain page.\nFaction Raiding\nRaiding is a purely destructive form of warring that was released on 08/01/19. Any faction may begin an indefinite raid against another faction, during which respect may only be taken from the opposition, rather than earned.\nDuring a raid, attacks made by either side during a raid will cause 100% respect loss (compared with the 25% loss caused by regular attacks).\nRespect that you take from the opposing faction will be added to your faction's raid score.\nAs with ranked wars and territory wars, full stats and graphs are available in a raid report once a raid is complete.\nInitiating a Raid\nFactions must have a minimum of 10 members to be able to declare a raid.\nA faction may only begin a raid with one faction at time. If your faction is involved in a raid, it will not be able to start another until the current raid is ceased. However, your faction may be raided by an unlimited number of factions at the same time.\nNote: If your faction starts a raid, it will force any current chain into its cooldown state, so chains should be finished before or started after your faction declares a raid.\nCeasing a Raid\nOnce 24 hours has elapsed, the faction with the highest score (most respect taken) gains the option to \"Cease\" the raid.\nThe losing Faction can also cease the raid if any of the following criteria are met:\nNo attacks are made by either party for 72 hours\nThe winning side has less than 10 members [2]\nThe faction with the lowest score may also choose to surrender at any time, however all this does is notify the opposing faction that you wish for the raid to be over. They may choose to accept your surrender and cease, or ignore it and continue.\nTraded peace treaties will cease & block raids for the agreed duration.\nIn rare cases a faction's total respect may reach 0, in which the faction is destroyed.\nFaction Destruction\nWhen a faction hits zero respect, they will be permanently destroyed. The faction will not be fully deleted, but it will enter an irrecoverable death state - this means the faction cannot be accessed, but its profile - showing its name, image, and previous leader - will be retained forever.\nUpon destruction, all members of the faction will be removed and any inventory which isn't loaned out will be moved to the leader including money and points.\nTerritories\nFor more information on the obtaining of territories, check here.\nRanked Warring\nFor more information on the Ranked Warring, check here.\nOutsider vs. Insider Hits\nThe criteria for an outside hit is shown below:\nEarly Discharge, for Outside Hits, is available at the start of a faction war. [3]\nOrganized Crime Panel\nMain article: Organized Crime\nThe Organized Crime Panel allows for planning of Organized Crimes. An Organized Crime is a group activity performed by members of a Faction in order to gain cash and respect for that faction, as well as Crime Experience for the members involved.\nThis panel allows for those with the proper permissions to plan and initiate Organized Crimes, and individuals who plan to leave the faction to cancel their own Organized Crime.\nUpgrades Panel\nThe upgrades panel is the nuts and bolts of faction management. It is split into two sections, the core branch and the special upgrades branch.\nAn upgrade from a core branch cannot be undone, so be careful when selecting these. This includes member capacity, armory upgrades, dirty bomb lab, territory upgrades, and chaining upgrades.\nThe special upgrades branch is where you can select your specials, you can choose up to 6 trees from a list of 8 trees. These can be swapped out instantly with another 'loadout' of upgrades.[4]\n\nArmory\nArmory\nUpgrade Respect Challenge\nWeapon Armory 1,000 N/A\nArmor Armory 1,412 N/A\nTemporary Armory 3,067 N/A\nMedical Armory 3,067 N/A\nDrug Armory 6,662 N/A\nBooster Armory 6,662 N/A\nPoint Storage 15,773 N/A\nLaboratory 105,027 Acquire 25 faction members\nChaining\nChaining\nUpgrade Max Chain Size Respect Challenge\nChaining I 10 1,412 N/A\nChaining II 25 2,173 Achieve a chain of 10\nChaining III 50 3,067 Achieve a chain of 25\nChaining IV 100 4,719 Achieve a chain of 50\nChaining V 250 6,662 Achieve a chain of 100\nChaining VI 500 10,251 Achieve a chain of 250\nChaining VII 1,000 15,773 Achieve a chain of 500\nChaining VIII 2,500 22,265 Achieve a chain of 1,000\nChaining IX 5,000 34,258 Achieve a chain of 2,500\nChaining X 10,000 48,358 Achieve a chain of 5,000\nChaining XI 25,000 74,404 Achieve a chain of 10,000\nChaining XII 50,000 105,027 Achieve a chain of 25,000\nChaining XIII 100,000 161,596 Achieve a chain of 50,000\nCapacity\nMember Capacity\nUpgrade Capacity Respect Challenge\nI 10 1,000 N/A\nII 15 1,412 N/A\nIII 20 2,173 Achieve a faction age of 10 days\nIV 25 3,067 Achieve a faction age of 20 days\nV 30 4,719 Achieve a faction age of 30 days\nVI 40 6,662 Achieve a faction age of 40 days\nVII 50 10,251 Achieve a faction age of 50 days\nVIII 65 15,773 Achieve a faction age of 75 days\nIX 80 22,265 Achieve a faction age of 100 days\nX 100 34,258 Achieve a faction age of 150 days\nTerritory\nTerritory Capacity\nUpgrade Capacity Respect Challenge\nTerritory I 1 1,295 N/A\nTerritory II 2 1,678 Hold 1 territory for 3 days\nTerritory III 3 2,173 Hold 2 territories for 3 days\nTerritory IV 4 3,067 Hold 3 territories for 3 days\nTerritory V 5 3,972 Hold 4 territories for 3 days\nTerritory VI 6 5,144 Hold 5 territories for 3 days\nTerritory VII 7 6,662 Hold 6 territories for 3 days\nTerritory VIII 8 8,628 Hold 7 territories for 3 days\nTerritory IX 9 12,180 Hold 8 territories for 3 days\nTerritory X 10 15,773 Hold 9 territories for 3 days\nTerritory XI 11 20,427 Hold 10 territories for 3 days\nTerritory XII 12 26,453 Hold 11 territories for 3 days\nTerritory XIII 13 37,341 Hold 12 territories for 3 days\nTerritory XIV 14 48,358 Hold 13 territories for 3 days\nTerritory XV 15 62,625 Hold 14 territories for 3 days\nTerritory XVI 16 81,100 Hold 15 territories for 3 days\nTerritory XVII 17 105,027 Hold 16 territories for 3 days\nSpecial Branches\nSpecial branches are bonuses that all of your faction members receive. You can assign your respect to these specials. Be wary though, specials can only be unset 72 hours after being set, so you can't just change up your specials constantly. Additionally, the upgrade cost is dependent on which slot the branch presides in, with the first slot being the base costs listed below, and each subsequent slot being double the cost of the previous one (An upgrade costing 1000 respect in the first slot will cost 2000 respect in the second, 4000 in the third, etc.)\nTo unlock additional specialization branches, a faction must have a specified number of upgrades active at the same time. Once the requirement to unlock a specialization branch is reached, it will be permanently unlocked, even if the total amount of upgrades the faction currently has drops below the specified number.\nBranch Unlock II: 20 upgrades\nBranch Unlock III: 45 upgrades\nBranch Unlock IV: 75 upgrades\nBranch Unlock V: 110 upgrades\nBranch Unlock VI: 150 upgrades\nIf you are interested in the old upgrades system, you can view those on this page.\nThis section is directly copied from Everything about faction specials by Harley [258120]\nYou can find more information on all the challenges you need to complete on this spreadsheet by FIN [527880] and Franky [1529693].\nThe Respect Simulator on YATA by Kivou [2000607] can also be used to predict respect required for each upgrade.\nToleration\nMain tree: Addiction: Reduce drug addiction up to 50%.

These balances increase when members donate money/points and decrease if they are given money/points. The 'payday' feature will not affect money balances. The balances can be adjusted to any value by the leader or co-leader; this only changes the member's displayed balance and has no other effect. Members can see their own personal balance on the armory page.\nYou can now use a URL request data to prefill the name & amount fields on the Give to user tab, to either give money or points, or add money or points to the user's balance. This will be in the format:\nTo give money\nhttps://www.torn.com/factions.php?step=your#/tab=controls&giveMoneyTo=1636201&money=100000 https://www.torn.com/factions.php?step=your#/tab=controls&addMoneyTo=1636201&money=100000\nTo give points\nhttps://www.torn.com/factions.php?step=your#/tab=controls&givePointsTo=1636201&points=100000 https://www.torn.com/factions.php?step=your#/tab=controls&addPointsTo=1636201&points=100000\nFaction Communication\nFaction Forums: The faction forums are a place for you to talk to your members, post ideas, services from the faction and offers.

This is one of the periods best known to earn the \"Champion\" honor bar, or any other Collectibles and Awards.\nChristmas:\nSimilar to Halloween, Christmas sees several weeks filled with Community Events, which can also be won to earn the \"Champion\" honor bar, or any of the many other Collectibles and Awards.\nURT\nURT was originally a player made tournament, which caught the attention of Chedburn and Sugarvalves. The event was made into a sanctioned annual event with unique prizes, designed especially for URT. More information is available here.\nVarious Daily Events:\nThere are several daily events, which also have a few Community Events. However, these are more rare.\nHistorical\nHamster:\nMassive giveaways used to be hosted on IRC for Halloween and Christmas. As IRC's popularity was declining, it was decided in 2016 to attempt the giveaways in Torn's chat system. The chat was unable to give an experience of a quality similar to IRC, so the event was discontinued.\nBody's Dollar sale\nUp until the early 2010s, Body [70242] used to host a dollar sale every Sunday during her radio show on Torn Radio. Body would announce the sale and then had several helpers to list hundreds of items over the course of an hour to the Item Market for $1 each. At the time, viewing a full category in the Item Market required pressing a link that opened a new page, which slowed buyers down and allowed for more competition.\nHuge varieties of items were given away, being both provided by Body hersel as well as donations from the community. While most items were lower in value, some expensive items such as Dual Melee weapons and 2005 Holiday Collectibles were given away on occasion.\nThe competition was extremely popular within the Torn community, but it dissolved with the end of Torn Radio and IRC. With Body much less active on Torn, there have been no successful attempts to bring this event back.\nWorld Population Day\nIn 2018 it was decided to give triple experience points for players who attacked and left an opponent on World Population Day.In 2019, the bonus was reduced to a double experience, although the attacking requirements were broadened to also include hospitalizations and muggings.\nEvent Time Slots\nTo improve Torn's performance during high-activity events, players are now given a staggered start time. Each player is randomly assigned a time slot between 10:00 TCT and 16:00 TCT in 15-minute increments when their account is created.\nYou can see your event start time at the top of the Calendar page. If you do not like your chosen time slot, you may change it to any other available time slot on the drop-down menu, provided it hasn't already been selected by too many other players.\nYour end time will also been adjusted accordingly, ensuring that you will always receive the same 48-hour event duration.\nThe list of events currently affected is:\nValentine's Day\nSt Patrick's Day\nEaster Egg Hunt\n420 Day\nMuseum Day\nWorld Blood Donor Day\nWorld Population Day\nWorld Tiger Day\nInternational Beer Day\nTourism Day\nCaffeineCon\nTrick or Treat\nWorld Diabetes Day\nSlash Wednesday\nChristmas Town\nPatch History\nReleased in Patch list #\nEvent Time Slots : 20/02/2024\nTo improve Torn's performance during high-activity periods, we've staggered the starting times of most events for all users. Rather than beginning at exactly 12:00 TCT, each player has been assigned a random time slot between 10:00 TCT and 15:00 TCT in 15-minute increments. Your end times have also been adjusted accordingly, ensuring that everyone will always receive the same 48-hour event duration.\nPatch list #128 : 11/04/2020\nChanged Valentine's Day Love Juice event to also reduce reviving costs by -15 energy (from 25 energy).\nPatch list #125 : 21/01/2020\nAdded \"Weekend Road Trip\" event for February which doubles racing points and racing skill for 48h.\nPatch list #83 : 26/02/2019\nAdded triple job points bonus for Employee Appreciation Day (First Friday of March).\nPatch list #78 : 22/01/2019\nAdded 'Awareness Awareness Week' event for 3rd week in January.\nPatch list #74 : 18/12/2018\nAdded event for 12th December 'Universal Health Care Day' : 75% hospital time reduction.\nPatch list #53 : 24/07/2018\nAdded \"International Tiger Day\" event for 29th July.\nPatch list #52 : 17/07/2018\nAdded World Population Day event (11th July).\nPatch list #47 : 12/06/2018\nAdded World Blood Donor Day event (14th June).\nPatch list #44 : 15/05/2018\nAdded 'Museum Day' 10% museum turn-in bonus for the 18th May.\nReferences\n↑ sugarvalves, Cannabis Day Begins Soon!

        "content": "Contents\n1 FAQ\n1.1 Level\n1.1.1 How do I level?\n1.1.2 Why can't I see how close I am to leveling?\n1.2 Crimes\n1.2.1 Why can't I do many crimes?\n1.2.2 Why do I keep going to jail?\n1.2.3 How can I increase my nerve bar?\n1.3 Marriage\n1.3.1 How do I propose/marry someone?\n1.3.2 How do I divorce someone?\n1.4 Hospital\n1.4.1 How can I get out of hospital?\n1.4.2 How do I revive people?\n1.5 Account\n1.5.1 Can I delete or restart my account?\n1.5.2 How do I change my account info?\n1.6 Rules\n1.6.1 I know someone who is using multiple accounts / breaking the rules, what should I do?\n1.6.2 If I have a relative or friend playing Torn City with me on the same IP, will I be banned?\n1.7 Other\n1.7.1 How do I regain energy, nerve and happiness?\n1.7.2 How do I gain points?\n1.7.3 What is my referral link?\n1.7.4 I can't find the Question and/or Answer I'm looking for!\n2 Bugs & Issues\n2.1 Typo, incorrect punctuation or a bug in the game?\n2.2 Bad split?\n2.3 Referral issue?\n2.4 Mission target in federal jail?\n2.5 Icons not showing?\n2.6 502 errors?\nFAQ\nLevel\nHow do I level?\nYou can level up by simply playing the game. Many things affect your chances of leveling, from playing in the casino, to training your stats. When you attack someone, you also gain more EXP if you leave them instead of hospitalizing or mugging them.\nWhy can't I see how close I am to leveling?\nYour Experience (points needed to go up levels) is hidden so you never know when you might be going up a level. This is one of the things that sets Torn apart from most online games. The element of surprise is always there! There is however the Fortune Teller which is unlocked at China after you hit level 15, using this will tell you how close you are to level. Fortune Teller costs 75,000 and tells you a percentage of how far you are from your next level, if you are level holding it merely states 100% instead of your true level.\nCrimes\nWhy can't I do many crimes?\nIf you are failing the crime, you do not have enough experience in crimes to do it. Successfully complete some of the lower crimes to gain crime experience. It is much better to continue on lower crimes than to move up too soon and fail larger crimes you were not ready for. It can be a slow process and takes time and patience. Critical fails (when you are injured, are sent to the hospital or jail) lower your crime experience more than normal fails.\nWhy do I keep going to jail?\nYou keep going to jail because you are trying crimes that are way too hard for you, you must be patient and slowly move up the crimes. If you are under 10 days old, there are ticks next to the crimes that you can do with a high chance of success.\nHow can I increase my nerve bar?\nYou can increase your natural nerve bar by doing crimes and earning crime experience. Your nerve bar increases in increments of 5 nerve at a time. The maximum natural nerve you can obtain is currently unknown. Remember, some crimes provide more crime experience than others. Critical fails are more harmful to increasing your natural nerve bar than other fails.\nMarriage\nHow do I propose/marry someone?\nYou must first get a ring. When you have the ring, you must go into your items page and click 'propose' next to your ring item. Once you have clicked propose you will need to know the players ID that you wish to marry so you can type it in. You can cancel your proposal in your player preferences if you should change your mind before the current pending proposal has been declined or accepted.You will also need to select witnesses to witness the marriage.\nHow do I divorce someone?\nShould you no longer wish to be with a player that you have married then you have the option to divorce the player at the Church. You cannot divorce your spouse until it is past 7 days after marriage. Keep in mind there are marriage length merits.\nHospital\nHow can I get out of hospital?\nMedical items reduce hospital time, recover health as well as add to a medical cooldown. This is the most common way to get yourself out of hospital. Another option is to get a player to revive you, this gets you out of the hospital and restores your health based on the revivers skill level. (Example: 75 skill gives 75% health). If a reviver service is used they typically want payment of various amounts. To be revived you have to have revived turned on. The drug Opium removes all hospital time unless you have radiation poisoning.\nHow do I revive people?\nIn order to revive other players you must first join the medical starter job. Once you reach the final position of 'Brain Surgeon', you will unlock a passive special allowing you to revive players. You can revive players from their profile or directly from hospital. The base energy to revive someone is 75, this can be reduced down to 25 with faction specials. You can leave the medical job after you have reached the Brain Surgeon position and you will keep the ability to revive.\nAccount\nCan I delete or restart my account?\nThe answer is yes, you may request your account to be deleted and you may restart a new account if you want to. Please read further information about this topic here New Account. You will be required to read that page entirely before the account will be removed and you're allowed to restart.\nHow do I change my account info?\nGo to preferences. The Gear icon at the top right corner of every page.\nRules\nI know someone who is using multiple accounts / breaking the rules, what should I do?\nIf you believe someone to be playing more than one account you should use the player report function to report the ID's in question. Allowing a staff member to check them out cannot hurt.\nIf I have a relative or friend playing Torn City with me on the same IP, will I be banned?\nNo, as of an update IP blocks have been removed from the game. Staff have determined that they are able to efficiently identify the difference between a multiple account and two legitimate players. As long as you don't play two accounts, you will not get banned: staff can tell.\n\nOther\nHow do I regain energy, nerve and happiness?\nYou are automatically funded 5 energy and happiness every 15 minutes. (every 10 minutes for energy if you are a donator) You gain 1 Nerve point every 5 minutes. Different drugs give different amounts, while also having different side effects and cooldowns. Types of candy can increase happiness, types of alcohol can increase nerve. Different boosters can also help you gain different effects (examples: EDVD: Happiness, Feathery Hotel Coupon: Energy). If you rehab in Switzerland it will completely fill your happiness bar.\nHow do I gain points?\nTo gain points, you can invite friends to Torn using your referral link. You can also purchase points from the points market located in the city. Becoming a donator or subscriber will reward you 60 and 90 points respectively. You also receive points (if you are still on crimes 1.0) by successful completion of Pawn Shop crime by using the side door option, however this has a high fail rate and if failed does a huge amount of damage to your nerve bar. Additionally spinning leslies wheel's have a chance of awarding you points\nWhat is my referral link?\nYou can access your referral link to give to your friends under the \"special\" section of the sidebar. Alternatively, you can click here. Accessing this page will also display all rewards available to you for referring friends. Please note this is an example of what your referral link will look like - http://www.torn.com/123456789 Another way to remember is just adding your user id after www.torn.com/ user id.\nI can't find the Question and/or Answer I'm looking for!\nIf you are 100% sure this is the case, use the Questions & Answers sub-forum and some friendly passerby may be able to assist you.\n\nBugs & Issues\nClick here to view any bug reports or to create your own. When creating a bug report please include as much information as possible, this includes using screenshots, explaining what browser/device you are using as well as what server you are on.\nBefore posting a bug report, please try clearing your browsers cache/cookies and disabling any extensions. This may be the cause of your issue.\n\nTypo, incorrect punctuation or a bug in the game?\nGo to the Bugs & Issues forum and post the error. Please include as much information as possible, this includes using screenshots, explaining what browser/device you are using as well as what server you are on.\nBad split?\nIf you played poker and you feel the winning pot was split unevenly (or wrong), please create a bug report with the table ID so that it can be checked.\nReferral issue?\nIf you referred someone to Torn but they have not been successfully linked to your Recruit Citizens list, please create a bug report and have your friend post there so that they can be added to your referral list.\nMission target in federal jail?\nThe mission system should automatically assign you a new target if the player is not attackable. If this is not the case please create a bug report with the ID of the player, and you will then be given a new target to attack.\nIcons not showing?\nPlease go to Preferences > Icon Settings > Refresh Icons.\n502 errors?\nGo here to post any 502 issues.\n\n\nReturn to Main Page"
